<p><p>Open content licences are tools at the disposal of creative people who want to use their copyrights in a permissive manner.
Their first aim is to allow the sharing and spreading of works, by granting rights to the users on a royalty-free basis.
However, these licences remain binding legal documents, according to which licensees must respect some obligations, and which are enforceable before courts.
The proposed presentation aims at providing an analysis of interesting court decisions where open content licences were at issue.</p>
