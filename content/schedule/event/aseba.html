<p><p>Aseba is an open-source project providing a set of tools that
allow beginners to program robots easily and efficiently.
Technically speaking, Aseba is an event-based architecture for
distributed control of mobile robots. It targets single- or
multi-processor robots and simulations. The core of Aseba is a
lightweight virtual machine tiny enough to run on
microcontrollers. With Aseba, we program robots in a
octave-style scripting language using an integrated development
environment. This environment provides several features
important for robotics, such as real-time inspection of
sensor/actuator data, integrating plotting, on-typing
compilation, distributed debugging, and instant code upload to
the robot. Compared to alternatives (for instance Arduino and
Lego Mindstorm), Aseba focuses on text-based programming but
takes advantage of the tight integration between the environment
and the robot to provide an interactive robot programming
experience.</p>

<p>Aseba stems from research in miniature mobile robotics, in which
small robots with multiple microcontrollers have risen
architectural questions (see papers under links). In addition,
Aseba has found a natural application in educational robotics
with the Thymio low-cost robot. We have also demonstrated Aseba
in simulation and on a group of e-puck robots. Aseba integrates
with D-Bus and ROS, allowing access to microcontrollers from
high-level languages.</p>

<p>I am the initiator and maintainer of the Aseba technology and
one of the most active contributors. I propose to present a talk
with the following content:
 * Genesis, why did we develop such a thing.
 * Technical overview, with discussion of the design choices.
 * Presentation of the Aseba in the robotic-research context.
 * Live demonstration of Aseba in the educational context using
  the Thymio robot.
 * Future directions.
 * Conclusion and question answering.</p>

<p>I started developing Aseba as part of my PhD work in the Mobots
research group at EPFL. Currently, a community comprising
members of the Mobots group, of the mobsya association, of the
ASL at ETH Zürich and other individuals maintain and further
develop Aseba.</p></p>
