<p><p>LPSP stands for LibreOffice extension providing connection to SharePoint. This Java extension is a great solution for users needing SharePoint support right now and/or don't consider upgrading (yet) to newer SharePoint versions supporting CMIS.</p>

<p>We'll also take a short time to explain about the CMIS connection and why it is a cool thing to hack on.</p></p>
