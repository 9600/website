<p><p>Mobile text input requires easy copy'n'paste interaction, reliable
cursor positioning and the ability to edit (or fix) previously written
text. For Asian markets, computer-assisted input of composed characters
is of paramount importance. A virtual keyboard alone cannot solve that.
For input methods to work, sophisticated platform and toolkit
integration is required.</p>

<p>The current general-purpose APIs that come with their respective input
method modules in UI toolkits such as GTK+ and Qt are not sufficiently
equipped for these tasks. Although the situation within the toolkits is
slowly improving, Maliit - a flexible and cross-platform input method
framework - can further narrow this functionality gap.</p>

<p>This talk will analyze problems of mobile text input and show how they
were solved on Nokia's N9.</p></p>
