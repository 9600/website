<p>Track: <a href="/schedule/track/lightning_talks">Lightning Talks</a></p>

<p><p>Q&amp;A session with core organizers. <em>The</em> opportunity to get in touch with us, to ask questions about organization aspects, to tell us what you love or hate, and to discuss anything FOSDEM related.</p></p>
<p><p>Everybody in the FOSDEM staff is a volunteer. We do this because we care about open source, and especially about the community.</p>

<p>What we do can be considered a kind of FOSS/community project. Hence, we love getting feedback and being in touch with the community. This session is created for that purpose. Come and talk to us!</p></p>
