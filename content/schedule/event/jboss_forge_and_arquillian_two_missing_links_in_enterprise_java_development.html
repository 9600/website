<p><p>One common complaint you hear a lot about enterprise Java development is that it is quite a burden to get started. For a newbie, it takes a lot of knowledge and effort to even put the simplest JSF application to work. A second element that bothers a lot of people is that it is very difficult to verify that your enterprise components actually do what they are supposed to do. Even for seasoned enterprise developers integration testing can be a huge challenge.</p>

<p>Luckily two recent additions to the JBoss toolset come to the rescue. Arquillian is a container-oriented testing framework built on TestNG and JUnit. It takes down the barrier of bootstrapping the necessary infrastructure when trying to perform integration tests. It lets you test your components in their real target runtime environment using real enterprise services. Secondly, JBoss Forge is an incremental enhancement tool that lets you take an existing Java project and safely add in new functionality. Whether you want to set up JSF, use persistence or enable integration testing with Arquillian, it all becomes a real breeze.</p>

<p>Attend this session to learn how to take advantage of both these tools. You will see how they can be used to rapidly create, test and deploy enterprise Java applications. I will also show how they can be extended to put them even to greater use. They truly will turn out to be the missing links you have been looking for in enterprise Java Development.</p></p>
