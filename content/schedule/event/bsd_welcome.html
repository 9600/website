<p><p>Operating systems distributed under the BSD or other permissive licenses such as the BSD family, Haiku, and Minix share many things in common with other FOSS licensed OSes like Linux, but also face different challenges. These challenges include the need for alternatives to widely used GNU tools and the often surprising discovery of users of our systems.</p></p>
<p><p>The BSD Licensed Operating System developers room will gather users and developers from BSD licensed OS projects to discuss their individual projects and ways they can help each other achieve their respective goals. Talks about developments in particular operating systems are welcome as are talks or forums on ways we can work together. We also welcome presentations on foundational technologies which are of interest to developers of BSD licensed operating system and presentations on derivative operating systems such as Debian GNU/kFreeBSD.</p></p>
