<p><p>pkgin is aimed at being an /apt / yum/ like tool for managing pkgsrc binary packages. Many so-called GNU/Linux distributions provide a convenient way of searching, installing and upgrading software by using binary archives found on "repositories". NetBSD, and more widely, all operating systems relying on pkgsrc have tools like pkg<em>add and pkg</em>delete, but those are unable to correctly handle binary upgrades, and sometimes even installation itself.</p>

<p>This is the purpose of /pkgin/, to provide the user a convenient way to handle binary packages, using the same working mechanisms than tools like /apt-get/.</p></p>
