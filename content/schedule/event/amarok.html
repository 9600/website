<p>Amarok is the old fart among the Free Desktop music players by now.
Newfangled software with "social" and "distributed" in their summeries
has come and taken some of the buzz from our old wolf.
But Amarok is still kicking! The recently released version 2.5 is
better then ever and even comes officially supported on Windows. But a
project is one foot in the grave if it does not have plans for the
future. Come gather around the warm buzzing projector kids, to hear
the story of Amarok's future on small pocketable devices and large
clumsy desktops.</p>

<p>&lt;/deliberate comedic effect></p>
