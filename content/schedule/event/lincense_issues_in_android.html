<p>Android is rapidly becoming the primary vector through which open source software is entering into people's life, with new devices being announced almost daily. Unfortunately companies are cutting many corners, especially when it comes to licenses and quality assurance, because everyone is rushing their devices to market. The consequence is that many Android devices out there are not compliant with the licenses, with significant legal risk as a result, even though it is completely avoidable with a small investment in time and knowledge up front, saving a lot of time and money down the line. In this talk I want to highlight a few common violations, shatter a few myths about Android and provide some hints on how to improve the situation. This talk will not be about software patents</p>
