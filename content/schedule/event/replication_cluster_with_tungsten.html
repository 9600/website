<p>Track: <a href="/schedule/track/mysql_and_friends_devroom">MySQL and Friends Devroom</a></p>

<p><p>Tired of the intricacies of circular replication? Dreaming of real multiple masters solutions for MySQL replication? Dream no more. Tungsten Replicator, a free and open source replacement for MySQL replication, can build clusters of asynchronous nodes in a matter of minutes. This workshop will explain the basics of Tungsten Replicator, and it will show how to start your multiple master cluster in a few minutes. There will be examples of several topologies: from the simplest bi-directional replication to the ambitious all-to-all (every node is a master), fan-in (multiple masters to a single slave), the star (a central hub connected to several bi-directional masters)</p></p>
