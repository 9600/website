<p><p>Being a part of a number of large Free Software projects over the last
years has been a wonderful time in so many ways. But over those years
I have also gotten to know another side of Free Software: trolls,
drama and gossip. Let me take you down the rabbit hole and show you
where it comes from, what you can do about it and why it's sometimes
even useful.</p></p>
