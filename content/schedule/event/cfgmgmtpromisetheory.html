<p>Do you feel lost after reading CFEngine tutorials? Does promise theory
seem to be distant from the particular CFEngine constructs?</p>
<p>In this talk CFEngine 3 operators will be dissected, analyzed and mapped to the ideas
in the promise theory.</p>

<p>Promise theory is a model of voluntary cooperation between individual,
autonomous actors or agents who publish their intentions to one another
in the form of promises, which is particularly suited for configuration
management in distributed systems. Promise Theory was proposed by Mark
Burgess in 2004, further developed in the following years and
implemented in CFEngine 3.</p>
