<p><p>Demonstration of building applications with the Adhearsion voice application development framework.</p></p>
<p><p>Many open source hackers see the allure of building applications that integrate with the
telephone network. However layers of industry jargon, proprietary technology and arcane
knowledge lead many to believe that telephony is "hard." Adhearsion will change their minds.
The Adhearsion project is an open source voice application development framework, the first
of its kind in the open source world. In this talk we will build several working voice applications
and demonstrate how to integrate them with existing PBX installations. Along the way, we will
discuss voice application design and show how to avoid common pitfalls.</p></p>
