<p><p>An overview of LTE/LTE-advanced technologies, and how ModemManager will work with LTE devices.</p></p>
<p><p>3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) is the new standard for high speed data
communications, an evolution of the 3GPP-family of standards (GSM,
UMTS...), but adopted also by CDMA networks as the next 4G technology.</p>

<p>ModemManager is a project running under the freedesktop.org umbrella,
which works with NetworkManager in order to provide easy setup of
broadband mobile connections in Linux-based systems. The new 0.6 release
of ModemManager will be able to handle mixed CDMA/LTE and GSM/UMTS/LTE
devices.</p>

<p>This talk will provide an overview of the new LTE and LTE advanced
technologies, from both network and device points of view; present the
new features arriving with this technology; and describe what is being
done in ModemManager to be able to manage 4G devices.</p></p>
