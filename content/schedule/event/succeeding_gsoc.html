<p><p>The Google Summer of Code (GSoC) has been a huge boon to the world of free and open-source software, and to Gentoo Linux in particular. In this talk, I'm going to share some of our successes, like how we manage 15â€“20 simultaneous internships and how we recruit a very large proportion of our students to continue as Gentoo developers.</p></p>
