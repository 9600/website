<p><p>Hear how LibreOffice is tackling our users demands both for an 'app', a web office suite, and a traditional fat client, and how we have fun while improving the software.</p></p>
<p><p>As the world moves simultaneously either to the cloud or towards 'apps' - come hear how LibreOffice is tackling our users' needs in both of these (apparently conflicting) directions with the same code-base.</p>

<p>See a demo of the LibreOffice On-Line prototypem, grasp the technologies, understand the benefits and problems of this model of web provision, and hear how you can play with / adapt gtk+ / broadway to your application. Hear about our handset / tablet developments, and our ongoing work to get smaller and faster. See how almost all the work we do for these products helps the normal fat-client office experience too.</p>

<p>Finally, of course some degree of catch up with the progress of LibreOffice as a code-base and community as we ship our version 3.5 will be presented, along with pointers for how to get involved in development.</p></p>
