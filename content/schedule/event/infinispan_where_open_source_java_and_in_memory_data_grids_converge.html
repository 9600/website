<p><p>In today's cloudy world of highly scalable applications, the database is increasingly the common culprit for most performance and scalability bottlenecks.  NoSQL is often touted as the solution to your data storage woes, but data grids are a very viable alternative as well, providing both a performance boost to those using relational databases in the form of a distributed cache, but also as a primary key/value store.  However, open source is crucial too since such systems often comprise of lots of cheap commodity-hardware nodes.  Proprietary solutions based on per-CPU licensing models may scale in terms of transactions per second, but fail to scale financially.  And this is where Infinispan comes in: the open source in-memory data grid for the JVM.</p>

<p>In this talk, Infinispan founder and project lead Manik Surtani will discuss the role of in-memory data grids in the Java ecosystem, in relation to cloud, PaaS and enterprise software.  Overlaps with NoSQL will also be discussed, as well as an update on JSR 107 and JSR 347, two JSRs that affect distributed caching and data grids.</p></p>
