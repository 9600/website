<p><p>Deploying from Git <code>git-deploy</code>, a tool to make rollouts and reverts easy, and the sort of development culture at Booking.com required to use the tool effectively, such as the the role of monitoring and testing.</p></p>
<p><p>Booking.com has recently open-sourced its internal development tool, git-deploy. Since its internal introduction in 2008 it has allowed developers and web designers to put code live in a simple and easy procedure, enabling them to roll code out into production within seconds of it being pushed to the master repository.</p>

<p>This talk covers the rollout framework, the tool itself and its internal workings, including per-subsystem tag creation and ability to stage changes before rollout and rapidly roll back, create hot fixes, automated rollout emails, change tracking, rollout history etc. We will also discuss the necessary development culture required to use the tool effectively, such as the the role of monitoring and testing.</p></p>
