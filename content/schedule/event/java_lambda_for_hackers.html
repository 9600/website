<p>Track: <a href="/schedule/track/free_java_devroom">Free Java Devroom</a></p>

<p><p>Lambdas in Java 8 will be the first major addition to the Java language since the Generics in Java 5,
while programming with a language that support lambdas/closures is way cool,
there are several traps and pitfalls to their introduction in Java.
This talk will explain the VM modifications already done and that will be done to support lambda in the JDK 8.</p></p>
