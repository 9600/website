<p><p>Version 1.12 of the X server is scheduled to be released in early March, shortly after FOSDEM occurs. The talk will cover what has changed since 1.11, including multi-touch support, and a raft of code cleanups to try and bring the server out of the last century.  Beyond 1.12, this presentation will outline further work planned for the Linux desktop. How X and Wayland will work together, the work remaining to support OpenGL 3.0 and beyond within the X environment and further plans to streamline and modernize the code base.</p></p>
