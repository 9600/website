<p><p>The libvirt library provides a hypervisor agnostic API for interacting with &amp; managing virtualization hosts. Traditional uses of virtualization have focused on running entire operating systems in virtual machines or containers. The libvirt-sandbox library builds on libvirt, LXC &amp; KVM, providing an API which facilitates the use of virtualization as a tool for building secure application sandboxes, without the additional burden of maintaining additional OS installations.</p></p>
