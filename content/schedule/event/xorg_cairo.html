<p><p>Cairo is the drawing API that is used predominantly by the GTK stack along with Firefox and couple of ports of WebKit. It is designed as a comprehensible page layout API rather than as a high performance interface to the GPU. It is Cairo's job to bridge the gap between an easy-to-use drawing model and efficient rendering. This is not always as easy as it sounds...</p>

<p>The talk will present the origins of Cairo, its successes, some of its failures, and the promising technologies for the future.</p></p>
