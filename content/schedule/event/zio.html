<p><p>The ZIO framework is a novel way to manage laboratory input/output.
It handles both data and meta-data, and is designed for multi-MB-per
second I/O in distributed systems.</p></p>
<p><p>ZIO is a framework for high-data-rate I/O.  The basic I/O item is a
block, made up of data samples and full meta-data information, so
input can be consumed offline and output cam be prepared in advance.
The main use cases are waveform generation and distributed
oscilloscopes, over possibly hundreds of systems spread over several
kilometers.  Within ZIO, the buffer and the trigger are first-level
objects, and both input and output have always been supported.  Data
flow is a pipeline made up of device, trigger and buffer; usually the
buffer is connected to char devices, but in-kernel users have been
written with minimal effort.</p>

<p>Code is being developed at http://www.ohwr.org/projects/zio and is
being submitted to the kernel.</p></p>
