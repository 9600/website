<p><p>In the talk we will talk about WebKitGTK+ [1] current status
and work done in the last months since last desktop summit. A
lot of things have happened in these months, we will summarize
the various WebKitGTK+ improvements in rendering (accelerated
compositing), accessibility, networking, etc. Also we will cover
WebKit2 architecture and initial version of the API, we will detail
the roadmap for WebKit2 support for WebKitGTK+. And or course some
nice demos :).</p>

<p>The talk should be interesting for embedders and those considering
integration of the web with the free desktop</p></p>
