<p><p>The goal of the Native Linux KVM Tool is to provide a clean, from-scratch, lightweight
KVM host tool implementation that can boot Linux guest images with no
BIOS dependencies and with only the minimal amount of legacy device
emulation.</p></p>
<p><p>The Native KVM tool was started as a response to Ingo Molnar's proposal
about a userspace tool which would sit under the /tools/ directory in the
kernel tree and be the usermode counterpart of the kernel side KVM
(the mail &amp; related thread can be found at
thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/962051/focus=962620 )</p>

<p>Biggest features of the tool are:
- Zero-config userspace networking for guests that have DHCP enabled
- SMP support
- No external BIOS required
- Experimental GUI support with SDL and VNC
- Host filesystem access via 9P/virtio
- Raw image support
- Host block devices as in-memory copy-on-write guest images on 64-bit hosts
- PPC64 Support
- Experimental QCOW2 image support</p>

<p>The tool was developed over the course of almost two years, and is now
in a stage where it is ready for merging into the kernel tree.</p></p>
