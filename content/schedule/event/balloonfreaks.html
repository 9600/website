<p>This talk is about taking pictures from above with a big latex balloon, helium,
strings, duct tape and CHDK, and making a nice video with the pictures using
python, GStreamer and OpenCV.</p>
<p>Some friends of mine and I got pretty busy last year on a crazy balloon
photography project. I want to share that experience, say what worked (helium,
CHDK, GStreamer)  and what didn't (crazy kite-balloon ideas, arduino
connectivity, and some other things, all due to a lack of time). Hopefully,
that would motivate hackers to get out of their basement and go do cool things
under the Sun.</p>
