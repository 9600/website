<p><p>Linker, compiler, runtime linker and the kernel can be improved to start applications significantly faster.</p></p>
<p><p>Optimizing application startup is hard, even measuring how long an application takes to start is a non-trivial problem.</p>

<p>This talk will consist of 3 main parts:
1. Ways of measuring IO patterns [on startup] using systemtap, gdb, valgrind
2. How to optimize IO patterns on startup given the limitations in existing tools
3. A list of proposed changes in the kernel, ld, ld.so, gcc that could significantly speed up application startup on Linux.</p>

<p>Additionally, the talk will compare application startup on Linux against other major platforms.</p></p>
