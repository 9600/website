<p><p>I will describe the technical and social aspects of documenting the Open Web, trying to extract common points applying to any open documentation project. I will present the different kinds of articles expected by the different users, their respective constraints and the solution we chose. I will talk about the accuracy problem and the communication processes. Finally I will speak about the challenges that the Open Web documentation is facing, like contributor motivation, the mobile Internet or new technological opportunities to improve the user experience.</p></p>
