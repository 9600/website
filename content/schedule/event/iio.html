<p><p>IIO (Industrial I/O) is a new kernel subsystem to allow easy userspace
interaction with data capture devices (ADCs, DACs, accelerometers,
light sensors, etc), while maintaining a high level of performance.</p>

<p>Based on a recent driver contribution using this subsystem, we will
detail how to build a simple driver using this subsystem and explore
how to use advanced features like triggered captures or buffering. We
will also explore IIO user space API and how to use it.</p></p>
