<p>Track: <a href="/schedule/track/jabber_and_xmpp_devroom">Jabber and XMPP Devroom</a></p>

<p><p>With XMPP you can build a webchat in a breeze, so nothing can go wrong, right?</p></p>
<p><p>The HelpIM chat software is about 10 years old now. We have rewritten it three times and with each rewrite we managed to make some major screw-ups. Recurring issues are: "how to reliably deliver the chat over the web", "how to route the messages within the server" and "how to authenticate over both HTTP and XMPP". With this talk I will save you from making the same screw-ups as we did.</p></p>
