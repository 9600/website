<p>Track: <a href="/schedule/track/free_java_devroom">Free Java Devroom</a></p>

<p><p>This talk will cover progress with OpenJDK on ARM.  It's
basically a progress report, but with some technical detail
about the changes needed for:</p>

<ul>
<li>The new Hard FP ABI.</li>
<li>ARM 7.</li>
</ul>


<p>I'll also discuss the issues that arise from the Java Memory Model
(also known as JSR 233.)  The talk will then be in two
halves, one part being very specific to Ed Nevill's ARM Assembler
interpreter and JIT, and the other part will cover the ARM more
generally.</p>

<p>If there's any time left I'll also cover the upcoming ARM8
architecture.</p></p>
