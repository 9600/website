<p><p>In GNOME, accessibility is a core value that touches all aspects of
the system. [1]</p>

<p>From the infrastructure, to the graphical toolkit, to the
applications, to the assistive technologies, accessibility has been a
central consideration from the very early days.</p>

<p>On April 2011 GNOME 3.0 was released, and although GNOME and the
accessibility made a huge effort, the accessibility support was not
ideal. But not are bad news. Finally the accessibility technologies
are starting to be used from the two main free desktops. AT-SPI is
starting to be used on KDE distros, and Orca is starting to be
functional with Qt apps. Since GNOME 3.0 a big effort was done in
order to improve the situation. At the moment of this proposal writing
an ATK/AT-SPI2 hackfest is being organized, in order to fix the issues
from the framework itself.</p>

<p>The purpose of this presentation is explaining:
  * Introduce accessibility on GNOME.
  * Briefly explain the status towards GNOME 3.4
  * Summarize the output of the ATK/AT-SPI2 hackfest
  * Compare GNOME 3.0 vs GNOME 3.4
  * KDE status and cooperation
  * Future</p>
