<p>Track: <a href="/schedule/track/free_java_devroom">Free Java Devroom</a></p>

<p><p>IcedRobot is an attempt to bring the Android API on OpenJDK.</p>

<p>It was first announced at Fosdem 2011, and after only two months of development and a team assembled during the customary Fosdem Free Java Hackers dinner, it was already able to translate most Android bytecode format to Java.</p>

<p>This presentation will review the last year of development and will explain future direction and plans for the project.</p></p>
