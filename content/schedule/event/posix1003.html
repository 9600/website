<p><p>"POSIX" stands for "Portable Operating System Interface".  The POSIX module in "Perl core" is ancient, full of quirks and historical mistakes. However, for that same reason, it will not get fixed. The new "POSIX::1003" (living on CPAN) tries to be an alternative: same functionality (and more), more consistent, and documented by function group.</p></p>
