<p><p>Recent developments in the Xen community mean that installing and configuring a Xen host has never been easier. However Xen remains both powerful and complex which can prevent a barrier to those wishing to deploy Xen.</p>

<p>In this panel discussion we will briefly present recent user facing changes to the way in which Xen is deployed (e.g. xend to xl toolstack migration, Project Kronos, pvops Linux kernel domain 0 support).</p>

<p>The bulk of the session will be an opportunity for users to describe problems which they are having deploying Xen and discuss the solution and possible future directions with a panel of Xen developers.</p></p>
