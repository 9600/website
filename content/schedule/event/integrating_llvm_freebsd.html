<p><p>The FreeBSD Project has been actively working to incorporate tools from the LLVM project into our base system including clang, libc++, and possibly lldb. This talk will cover our efforts so far including our plans to ship FreeBSD 9.0 with clang in the base system. I will cover both our current work to replace GPL licensed components with BSD(ish) licensed components and future or experimental work to incorporate new technologies made possible by LLVM.</p></p>
