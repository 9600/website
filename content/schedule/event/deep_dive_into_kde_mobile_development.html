<p><p>The Nokia N9 phone has recently been released to the public, running the shiny
MeeGo 1.2 Harmattan. External developers were able to get such devices via
several mediums. Qt is at the center of this platform. It provides a great set
of tools and libraries that make this device very accessible and give an
excellent way to learn Qt development; also to experiment with KDE Mobile
application development. In this presentation the KDE Mobile development
workflow will be presented. Practically almost everything you need to know about
how to make or port a KDE application for those gadgets and how to make the most
out of the development tools.</p></p>
<p><p>During the presentation, there will be some notes about general hints and the
development environments potentially available. We will see how to package your
KDE Application for testing and later publishing. You can pick up technical tips
and tricks for free that others have already spent a decent amount of time with.
There will be some practical hints about application testing methodologies, and
in general how to survive with the security framework from an authorized person
regarding the topic. Last, but not least: you will see how to cooperate with Ovi
store and their QA requirements. We will also have a look at the newly formed
"Apps For MeeGo", community driven store. In other words, the idea of the
publishing story. Speaking of which, the Community OBS will also be presented
along with the fallback KDE repository for distributing packages for developer
purposes. In the end, we will have a small demo session about the already
available KDE applications for this mobile handset platform.</p></p>
