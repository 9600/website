<p>Track: <a href="/schedule/track/microkernel_os_devroom">Microkernel OS Devroom</a></p>

<p><p>One shiny aspect of the Genode OS framework is its diversity with
respect to microkernels and hardware platforms it's running on top of.
Although primarily of interest to clients and users, this property
provides some hidden benefits to the system-developer itself.
This talk is basically an experience report. It will give you an insight
into the benefits and troubles of developing on a diverse biotope, the
strength and weaknesses of the available platforms, how Genode gets
ported to a kernel, and what is basically necessary from the kernel's
perspective to drive Genode. The last point will be illustrated by
introducing recent developments of a hybrid kernel/user API in Genode.</p></p>
