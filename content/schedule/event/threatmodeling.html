<p><p>Sick of ludicrous security theater?  Banish it in your organization!</p></p>
<p><p>Security is frequently done in an ad-hoc manner, either entirely without a formal threat model, or with one, but without any attempt to connect mitigations to the threat model.  Even in those organizations which have a threat model, it's created in secret and updated in secret, if at all.</p>

<p>I'll present the down sides of the current approaches, and present a new way to approach modeling threats.</p></p>
