<p><p>The Openmoko Freerunner, the open source and HW mobile phone, is alive and kicking. During this talk we provide a status of the current active and stable platforms ported to the Freerunner (SHR, QtMoko, Android and Debian).</p></p>
<p><p>The community is also producing the newcomer with codename GTA04. The device is already available for pre-ordering. The new phone is 3,75G enabled, has superior characteristics compared to the Freerunner (GTA02)  and fits in the current Freerunner casing. During the talk we will shed some light on the status of the project.</p></p>
