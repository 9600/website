<p><p>Interchange is an Open Source e-commerce software written before the advent of any modern Perl. Thus we implemented a lot of things like running a server, dispatching, parameter parsing, session handling and templating. We decided to reduce the source code drastically by using modules from CPAN like Dancer, PSGI and Template::Flute instead of our own custom code.</p></p>
<p><p>Interchange will become a collection of a few base modules providing an API for carts, payment, shipping and access control which can be extended easily with plugins. This provides you with a solid, fast, simple and flexible platform for your online business based on modern Perl, which is going to be demonstrated during the presentation.</p></p>
