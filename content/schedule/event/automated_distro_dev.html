<p><p>Presenting tools and workflows used via Open Build Service by various distributions to develop the distribution. This includes automated source processing, validation, QA, automated and manual reviews.</p>

<p>Additional focus point on maintenance handling, means updates after a distribution is released which are usually done in a complete different way.</p>

<p>I like to have a discussion about the question how distributions should validate trustable sources and how the trust can be increased by a common distro effort.</p></p>
