<p>Track: <a href="/schedule/track/mono_devroom">Mono Devroom</a></p>

<p><p>Gluon is an open source database schema analysis and entity/relationship mapper that easily integrates into MonoDevelop. Using the MonoDevelop addin you can browse databases, select tables, generate entities (including bulk rename operations) and add the generated C# code to your project with a couple of clicks. If my cats will help with the coding it will probably support schema migration (from inside MonoDevelop) well before the FOSDEM. If they don't help there will be enough to talk anyway (and nice catfur dolls for everybody).</p></p>
