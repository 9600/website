<p><p>In this session you'll learn how to choose hardware that helps MySQL execute queries the most quickly, while providing the best price-to-performance ratio. This includes choosing and configuring CPUs, RAM, network, and storage systems. We'll also discuss what performance you can expect from various Amazon EC2 instance sizes, including EBS volumes and Amazon's RDS service for MySQL.</p></p>
