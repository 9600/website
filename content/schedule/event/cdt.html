<p><p>The Eclipse community's support for C and C++ programmers is continuously improving.  Coupling this support for editing and debugging with integration of existing Linux tools for profiling and analysis gives C and C++ programmers a powerful, one-stop-shop environment.  Valgrind, OProfile, and RPM integration?  This isn't your grandfather's Eclipse.  Come see it in action!</p></p>
