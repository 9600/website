<p><p>Our "Soft Emergency Call System" solves two problems: event aggregation and event visualization.</p></p>
<p><p>We designed a "Soft Emergency Call System" to deploy in local government to provide care in an aging society.  In the design process we had 2 issues ("Event Aggregation" and "Event Visualization"). We describe two ideas to solve those issues, and introduce the system's implementation and development environment.</p></p>
