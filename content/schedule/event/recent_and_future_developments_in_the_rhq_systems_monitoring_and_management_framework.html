<p><p>This talk will give a quick intro into the RHQ systems management and monitoring system and then show recent developments like "Dritf", the detection of changes of files and configurations, the REST api for easy access to collected data from other programming languages. Last but not least I want to point out some possible future development - especially in the area of alerting.</p></p>
