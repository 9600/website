<p><p>With iOS 5 and OS X 10.7, Apple introduced a number of new Objective-C features. With the release of version 1.6 of the GNUstep Objective-C runtime and version 3.0 of clang these are now all available to GNUstep developers. The new features include better data hiding, automatic reference counting, and a number of other features. This talk will cover these features, as well as some of the extensions beyond Apple's version and the improvements in Objective-C performance since FOSDEM last year.</p></p>
