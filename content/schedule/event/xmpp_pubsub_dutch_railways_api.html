<p><p>Implementation of PubSub, Service Discovery and User Location on top
the Dutch Railways API.</p></p>
<p><p>Dutch Railways has opened up an API to their presentation layer. The
API hooks into the back office and contains similar data as can be
found on stations and their website. The system is pull based, and has
a limitation of 40k request per unique API key, the format: XML.</p>

<p>The openOV project removed the requirement for the API key by acting
as open proxy, caching request and offering a PubSub allowing
subscriptions to specific stations. Upon changes any subscriber gets
informed, in realtime. Additional views in virtual nodes were made to
retrieve data of a single train passing by stations.</p>

<p>Some commercial partners popped up such as <a href="http://42transit.com">http://42transit.com</a>
doing BOSH, to our service.</p></p>
