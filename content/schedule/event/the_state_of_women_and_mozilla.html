<p>Track: <a href="/schedule/track/mozilla_devroom">Mozilla Devroom</a></p>

<p><p>Women &amp; Mozilla (WoMoz) is a community driven project that aims at improving diversity and giving more visibility to women within Mozilla and FLOSS. This talk will be the occasion to go over the different projects that were launched since WoMoz was created: education, conferences, workshops, mentoring... are only a few of the areas that we've covered over the past year.</p>

<p>This will also be the opportunity to engage in a discussion with the participants, in order to know how we can continue growing, and to gather ideas and feedback for future projects in the years to come.</p></p>
