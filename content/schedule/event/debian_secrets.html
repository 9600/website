<p><p>Debian is usually advertised as a volunteer project with a subtle mix of democracy and do-ocracy. While this is correct, implementation details are mostly undocumented, and it is often difficult for prospective or relatively new contributors to really understand the inner workings of the project.</p>

<p>This talk will detail some useful lessons, and also some secrets about Debian learned over the years. It is hoped that it will be helpful to people willing to get things done in Debian.</p></p>
