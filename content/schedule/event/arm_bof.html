<p><p>More and more distributions are porting their software to run on ARM CPUs. This is a session for people working on or otherwise interested in those ports to share progress reports, problems and ideas.</p>

<p>Steve will start the discussion with the current status of the two ARM ports in Debian ("armel" and "armhf"), but is not planning on spending the whole session on that!</p></p>
