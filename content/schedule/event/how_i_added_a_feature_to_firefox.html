<p><p>A lot has been said about writing your first patch, but how about adding a new feature?</p>

<ul>
<li>What's the impact that volunteer contributors can have in innovating the browser?</li>
<li>Who is going to work with you and what's your role as a developer?</li>
<li>What can you do to ensure the work you start will be completed?</li>
</ul>


<p>We'll talk about these topics using the Firefox Downloads Panel as a real-world example.</p></p>
