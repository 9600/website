<p><p>The CERN accelerator control systems access equipment distributed over a
geographic area tens of kilometers across.</p>

<p>When off the shelf hardware is not available engineers design and prototype I/O
devices as needed. With the advent of the open hardware repository,
collaborations between the physics laboratories, research institutes and
industry now ensure high quality designs and generality. The manufacture of
these devices may be tendered out to industry and the companies involved are
free to add them to their own catalogs.</p>

<p>The control system requires very precise timing and synchronization of control
and acquisition values over a large area and a diverse array of configurable
equipment connected to the accelerators. Great care is required to manage the
control system timing and configuration so that remote FPGA cores are set up
correctly.</p>

<p>The “White-Rabbit” timing project is open and addresses the future timing
and synchronization needs for CERN and other laboratories. White-rabbit makes
use of synchronous Ethernet and uses ideas from IEEE 1588 PTP protocol to
synchronize remote equipment up to 10Km apart to better than one nanosecond.</p>

<p>Various control system devices at different geographic locations will have on
board FPGA logic loaded dynamically by carrier FMC device drivers with
configuration data. Device specific drivers then scan the FPGA configuration
via a Wishbone-standard bus to determine the installation and if any further
configuration is needed.</p>

<p>Etherbone is a software extension of the Wishbone hardware standard permitting
remote FPGA cores to communicate with each other and with other control system
components.</p>

<p>The variety of I/O peripherals, their wide range of activation mode
and the requirement to move several megabytes of data per channel per
second is managed by ZIO, a new I/O framework designed to handle
the usual I/O channels but also pulse generation and sampling; all
peripherals may also be white-rabbit-aware, so that their own
timestamps are more precise than what the host computer can offer.
Although ZIO examples drive simple I/O channels, the system is able
to DMA directly to user space, to sustain high data rates.</p></p>
