<p><p>Project-Builder.org is a GPL v2 tool designed to help projects developers producing easily packages for multiple OS and architectures, on a regular basis, from
+a single source repository.</p>

<p>The various aspects covered by the tool are:
- only produce software packages (ease integration in deployment servers, provide inheritance mecanisms, ...)
- ease the various steps of solution life cycle (controlled impact of installation/uninstallation, dependencies management, identical deliveries up to customer,
+announce management, web site delivery, metadata management)
- help projects packages provisioning (templates/skeletons, generated structure)
- Avoid code/metadata duplication (macro system, separate repository)
- Neutral (repository, system, package type agnostic)</p></p>
<p><p>Reduces cost by providing process, method and tools to realize continuous packaging during the whole project life cycle.</p>

<p>Today the tool supports:
- Muliple repository (tarballs, SVN, CVS, Git, Mercurial, SVK...)
- Multiple systems ((RPM Linux, deb Linux, ebuild , Solaris pkg)
- Multiple build environments (local, VM, VE)
- Multiple repository manager (yum, urpmi, apt)</p>

<p>Used by MondoRescue, LinuxCOE, itself, referenced by vcs-pkg.org</p></p>
