<p>After reminding you what Banshee is and why you love it, we’ll go
through some of the features that have been added recently, and give
you a glimpse of what we’re working on these days. We’ll then look
into the future and try to guess what it might bring to Banshee. We’ll
also show you how can be part of that future, by contributing a patch,
filling bugs or writing an extension.</p>

<p>When you develop a major multi-platform desktop application that is
used by millions of people, you sometimes have to do some crazy stuff.
So we’ll share with you some of those things. Some of them will make
you laugh, some of them will make you cry, but all of them qualify for
at least one of the following adjectives : crazy, ridiculous, insane,
unreasonable, awesome.</p>
