<p><p>Amber is an implementation of the Smalltalk-80 language that runs on
top of the JavaScript runtime. Amber brings client side scripting to
the next level. Imagine developing directly in an IDE in your web
browser: write unit tests, debug, inspect, save and run your code
without hitting the refresh button.</p>

<p>In this session, we will:</p>

<ul>
<li> Show how to get started with Amber</li>
<li> Show how the JavaScript integration works</li>
<li> Show examples of how to access and quickly wrap existing JavaScript libraries (e.g. Google Maps, Ace editor)</li>
<li> Discuss how Amber can be easily incorporated into existing webapplications - regardless of the back-end (Ruby, PHP, Seaside, etc) and how it can co-exist with existing client-side JavaScript</li>
<li> Show some nice applications written in Amber</li>
</ul>
</p>
