<p><p>A new project whose distinguishing feature is not reinventing the wheel.</p></p>
<p><p>Recently, Dave discovered a batch processing protocol called Hututupuh. Looking into it (it's apparently quite popular), he noticed a habit of Hututupuh developers to reinvent often key areas, such as endpoint identifiers, authentication, and notifications.</p>

<p>Since the XMPP world has had these working just fine for quite a while (usually by reusing things like SASL), Dave wondered what would happen if you let XMPP do some of the heavy lifting. Hututupuh developers will, now doubt, rejoice at having a simple, ready-made solution available to them, with a pre-existing global infrastructure and wide support.</p></p>
