<p><p>"Apple drops GPL apps" was a headline in the Linux User &amp; Developer Magazine in 2011. Later Windows followed the example of Apple. So does this mean GPL licensed apps can't go mobile? Luckily, it's not that dramatic. This talk will share the first hand experience of the challenges and opportunities of releasing GPL based apps in the Apple app store.</p></p>
