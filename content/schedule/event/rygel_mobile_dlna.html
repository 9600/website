<p><p>Getting to the point of having a working, low-resource DLNA-ready
implementation is a hard task. Fortunately there's an easy way out -
Rygel. It is a modular and extensible solution to help you out of that
dilemma with minimum effort.</p>

<p>Rygel started its life for GNOME Mobile and was the designated UPnP/DLNA
stack for Maemo Freemantle and MeeGo/Harmattan. It is supposed to work
out-of-the box with no setup required, operating nicely with all kinds
of quirky devices.</p></p>
