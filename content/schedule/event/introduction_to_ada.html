<p><p>Overview of the main features of the Ada language, with special emphasis on those features that make it especially attractive for free software development.</p></p>
<p><p>Ada is a feature-rich language, but what really makes Ada stand-out is that the features are nicely integrated towards serving the goals of software engineering. If you prefer to spend your time on designing elegant solutions rather than on low-level debugging, if you think that software should not fail, if you like to build programs from readily available components that you can trust, you should really consider Ada!</p></p>
