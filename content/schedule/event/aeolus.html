<p><p>Aeolus Project is a Red Hat sponsored project released under Apache License. It's purpose is to help people to have their own solution to manage and create cloud system hybrid and then run their instances on their own in-house infrastructure (VMware vSphere, RHEV, IBM's Smart Business Cloud, Eucalyptus) and also copy/run/manage their instances in multiple public cloud places (Amazon EC2, Rackspace, GOGrid,etc)</p></p>
<p><p>Aeolus does all of the image conversion/transfer/etc automatically, handling everything properly. Aeolus is a single, consistent set of tools to build and manage organized groups of virtual machines across clouds.</p></p>
