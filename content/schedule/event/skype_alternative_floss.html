<p><p>The University of Strasbourg has built a 'Skype replacement' for ~60,000 users using open source standards and software.</p></p>
<p><p>A few years ago the French Ministry of Education and Research, issued a memo that strongly advised against use of Skype in universities and research centers. Security and excessive bandwidth consumption were among the main concerns.</p>

<p>In practice however, the directive has been rarely applied for one major reason: (perceived) lack of alternatives.</p>

<p>Therefore, in the beginning of 2011, the University of Strasbourg has started an effort that aims to propose an actual Skype alternative to both its faculty and students (~60 000 users). The project started with a number of extensions added to the Jitsi project in order to add support for features such as GTalk interoperability for example.</p>

<p>It then continued with a deployment of the actual network using exclusively FLOSS projects such as Openfire, Jinglenodes, FreeSWITCH/Asterisk, TurnServer and others.</p>

<p>The talk will also cover aspects such as NAT traversal with ICE and JingleNodes, redundancy, security and confidentiality.</p></p>
