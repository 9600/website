<p>Track: <a href="/schedule/track/libreoffice_devroom">LibreOffice Devroom</a></p>

<p><p>Above all else, LibreOffice is a vast corpus of C++ source code of varying quality. Static analysis of that giant code base guarantees a constant stream of interesting findings. The talk will look at how plugin architectures of modern C++ compilers allow to tap that stream.</p></p>
