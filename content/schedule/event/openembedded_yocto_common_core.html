<p><p>OpenEmbedded and the Yocto Project have recently changed their structure
to collaborate around a common base: OpenEmbedded-Core, with additional
layers being developed to be used on top. Moving to a multi-layer structure
presents both organisational advantages and challenges.</p>

<p>This presentation will cover both technical and community aspects and will
include recent developments in Yocto Project / OpenEmbedded structure, the
current layer landscape, best practices for developing new layers and growing
existing ones, and layer tooling enhancements developed as part of the Yocto
Project that will benefit the entire OE community, as well as future plans
along those lines.</p></p>
