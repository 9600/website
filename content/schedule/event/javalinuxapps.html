<p><p>I've written a modest desktop application to manage my Altus Metrum
rocketry electronics. The first implementation used C and Gtk+. I
eventually gave up on that implementation and started over using Java
and Swing. The application now consists of about 25kloc using a
collection of external java packages for things like speech synthesis,
graphing and mapping. This presentation will describe what my experience
with Gtk+ was like and why I was motivated to start over.</p></p>
