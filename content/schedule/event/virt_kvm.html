<p><p>The KVM hypervisor entered the Linux kernel at the beginning of 2007 and, since then, it has progressed a lot in terms of scalability, performance and features.  Together with it, an entirely open-source stack of user-mode virtualization tools has come into existence and seen vigorous development.  Its components include management tools (libvirt, oVirt), guest rescue and inspection tools (guestfish), desktop virtualization (spice), user interfaces (virt-manager and now Boxes).  The stability of the hypervisor and the fast-paced development of the tools created a virtuous circle that is quickly bridging the gap between proprietary and open-source virtualization.</p>

<p>In this talk, I will highlight the recent additions to KVM and the accompanying tools, and present features that are new or in the works.</p></p>
