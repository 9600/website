<p><p>Univention Corporate Server (UCS) is a Debian-derived distribution focused on enterprise environments and heavily based on LDAP.
In contrast to most other Debian-derived distributions it is based on Debian stable instead of snapshots from Debian unstable.</p>

<p>With it's earliest development roots dating back ten years, UCS is now used in approx. 700 installations with the biggest having 80,000 users.</p></p>
<p><p>This technical talk will cover the following topics:
- Basing on Debian stable: Benefits and challenges
- Introduction to a few features specific to UCS:
* Template-based configuration management with Univention Configuration Registry
* "Listener/notifier" domain replication
* Synchronisation of OpenLDAP and Active Directory using the Univention AD Connector
* Web-based administration with the Univention Management Console
- UCS is the first distribution to include Samba 4 in a supported product</p>

<p>The talk will provide an overview of the supported features, e.g. assigning group policy objects to Windows clients.</p></p>
