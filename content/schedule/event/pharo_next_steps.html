<p><p>Pharo is slowly but steadily emerging. A more robust and cleaner infrastructure has been put in place. In this session we will describe the steps achieved so far in Pharo and the next ones we want to achieve: like having a better FFI, integration process, smaller kernel, new scalable canvas API. In addition we want to give the opportunity to pharoers to ask questions, raise points of discussions.</p></p>
