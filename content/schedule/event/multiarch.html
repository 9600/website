<p>Multiarch is a properly generic solution to the installation and use of library packages from one than one architecture at a time, which changes the way running non-native binaries and crossbuilding are dealt with in a fundamental way. It is both powerful and intrusive and has taken a long time to make happen.</p>

<p>This talk explains what it is, how it works, and what you can do with it. We will also discuss future adoption by other distros.</p>
