<p><p>Debian has a number of legacy tools (that's a euphemism for ugly hacks) that are not addressed due to inertia, fear of breaking stuff, and the difficulty of reaching consensus for changes with cross-package impact. I'll talk about dealing with the above issues in the context of ongoing work as part of Debian Enhancement Proposal 9.</p>

<p>Specifically, the talk will cover how (not) to make proposals for cross-package changes, and how to map behaviour in a technical spec to feature-centered assertions in a test suite.</p></p>
