<p><p>So-called "app stores" are becoming a popular means of distributing
software, particularly for mobile devices. However, the rise of app
stores has been accompanied by tensions with free software/open source
legal norms. Companies controlling official app distribution channels
for their platforms typically place restrictive terms on both users
and developers in ways that may be difficult or impossible to
harmonize with requirements and expectations around FLOSS
licensing. Moreover, there is a perception that noncompliance with
FLOSS licenses is prevalent in app store distribution. This panel will
explore some of the problems arising out of the intersection between
app stores and FLOSS, under EU as well as US law, and will discuss
possible solutions.</p></p>
