<p>Wayland is a next generation display manager that is hopefully the
future for graphics in the Free Desktop. It provides an opportunity to
avoid some of the historical baggage associated with X - and enable
smoother and more flexible user experiences.</p>

<p>In this talk i'll show of the status quo of various toolkits running
on Wayland - including GTK+, Clutter, Mx and with a special guest
appearance from Tiago Vignatti to show off the state of the QT port.</p>

<p>We'll talk about what works and what doesn't and what application
level programmers need to think about when porting their application
to run under Wayland. In particular input is a field where X has
lagged behind current technology - Tiago will show how the exemplary
input architecture in Wayland can be exploited to create compelling
modern user experiences.</p>
