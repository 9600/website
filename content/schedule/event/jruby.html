<p>Track: <a href="/schedule/track/free_java_devroom">Free Java Devroom</a></p>

<p><p>JRuby is Ruby on the JVM, and the first mainstream JVM
language to make use of invokedynamic. We also have worked around
limitations in OpenJDK's APIs (process mgmt, IO, native POSIX support)
in many clever ways. Lots to talk about here.</p></p>
