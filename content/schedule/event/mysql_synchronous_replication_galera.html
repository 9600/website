<p><p>Everywhere here and there you hear about MySQL synchronous Replication with Galera as a replacement for MySQL Master-Master Replication. But nobody has seen it yet in practice. In this talk we look at the architecture, the installation, the configuration and the pitfalls you have to expect with synchronous Galera Replication for MySQL during operation</p></p>
