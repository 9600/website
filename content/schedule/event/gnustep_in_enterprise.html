<p><ol>
<li>An overview of the problem of dealing with multiple server processes on multiple hosts and sites.  How to provide fault tolerance and how to scale up without losing control.</li>
<li>A discussion of the use of the basic technologies such as Distributed Objects and property lists etc to implement these systems.</li>
<li>Control ... how we start/stop server processes, prevent duplication of processes, support automated restart, and query the state of processes.</li>
<li>Configuration ... how we provide specific configuration to each process under central control, yet allow those servers to operate independently.</li>
<li>Logging/Alarming ... how we provide and manage simple and consistent audit/debug logging facilities for server processes, and how we integrate with SNMP.</li>
