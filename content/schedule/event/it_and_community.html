<p>Mozilla IT has been managed for a too long time by paid-staff only. We are now moving toward opening it to the community, be as open as possible.</p>

<p>This talk will be about how we're doing it, but it is also an opportunity to gather feedback and exchange with the OSS projects that have always been working that way.</p>
