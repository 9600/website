<p><p>Is your Android code easy to write, to read and to maintain?
AndroidAnnotations is an Open Source Android framework that aims at simplifying your Android developments, without performance cost.
AndroidAnnotations helps you build Android Applications faster because it allows you to focus on your business problem rather than the plumbing code that connects components and systems.
Simply put, AndroidAnnotations generates the boring boilerplate code of your application at compile time, using the Java 6 Annotation Processing API.
The presentation will start by explaining the key concepts, followed by a live coding of a simple Android application, to demonstrate AndroidAnnotations' advantages.</p></p>
