<p>Track: <a href="/schedule/track/perl_devroom">Perl Devroom</a></p>

<p><p>Moose is a post modern object system for Perl 5. It removes the tedium of writing object oriented code and gives developers powerful tools to express themselves. This talk is a bare bones essentials primer to getting a developer's feet wet with Moose. It will cover class construction, roles, attributes, and type constraints.</p></p>
