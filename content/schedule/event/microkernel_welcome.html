<p><p>This short talk is intended as the opening talk of the entire devroom.
After a welcome greeting, I will briefly ponder about the motivation for
meeting together and attempt a basic quantitative comparison of
participating projects based on available project-metric data. The goal
of this quick comparison is to illustrate some apparent similarities and
differences between our projects, and to further support our common cause.</p></p>
