<p><p>Battle for Wesnoth has a reputation for being a balanced game, but it took many years to get there.
This was a long learning process, not only to get a balanced game, but also to learn how to use the resources available specifically to open source software and use them in the best possible way to reach a game that is challenging without being impossible and fair to all players.</p></p>
