<p><p>Boxes is a new GNOME application to create and access local and
remote systems, such as virtual machines or remote desktop. A local
machine is powered by KVM &amp; Spice, and you can access remote desktop
via libvirt, SPICE and VNC (and more coming). Boxes is made for you,
developers, contributors, and users of application running on other systems.
During this talk we will demo latest version and describe the design of
Boxes. We will discuss the importance of Boxes as part of the
GNOME project. Finally, a list of missing features and the roadmap
for the next cycle will be presented.</p></p>
