<p><p>XWT is a new cross platform GUI toolkit for Mono and .NET, which is based on the idea of building an abstract widget library on top of platform-specific native widgets. This toolkit is still in a very early development stage, but there are already backends for GTK+, MonoMac and some initial work on WPF. The talk will explain the goals of the project and some details about design principles and internal architecture.</p></p>
