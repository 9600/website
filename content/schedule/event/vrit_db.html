<p>Track: <a href="/schedule/track/mysql_and_friends_devroom">MySQL and Friends Devroom</a></p>

<p><p>Let's have a look at the why and how of virtualization and see how it impacts applications with a big hunger for resources. We will run through the different layers of a virtualized environment and examine their impact. Can we tune MySQL to be better adapted to a virtual environment?</p></p>
