<p>Track: <a href="/schedule/track/crossdesktop_devroom">CrossDesktop Devroom</a></p>

<p><p>In this talk we'll see how web applications are being integrated into the
new GNOME 3 experience. We'll cover both the current status of the
specifications and its support in GNOME 3.2 through the Epiphany
application mode and the new developments in the multiple emerging
standards (Mozilla OpenWebApps, Chrome applications, WAC applications, W3C
widgets, etc) and how we plan to support them in future versions of GNOME.</p></p>
