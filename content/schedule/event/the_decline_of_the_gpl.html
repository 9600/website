<p><p>Discussion of the possible decline of copyleft licensing.</p></p>
<p><p>During the past few years some have asserted that the use of
copyleft licenses, particularly the GPL, is in decline among
FLOSS projects. While the data that is said to support this
contention may be suspect, it matches my own observations and
experience.</p>

<p>I examine why the GPL may really be experiencing some decline
relative to noncopyleft licensing. Many factors are likely to
have played a part, sometimes in contradictory or nonobvious
ways, including the evolution of open source "business models",
the nature of GPL enforcement and nonenforcement, the drafting of
GPLv3 and its aftermath, changes in moral and legal authority
surrounding the GPL, and general technological, cultural and
economic developments affecting free software hackers.</p>

<p>If it is real, the GPL's decline is a problematic development for
free software culture. I propose ways in which the trajectory of
relevance and influence of strong copyleft can be turned around.</p></p>
