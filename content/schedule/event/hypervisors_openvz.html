<p>The talk is about operating system virtualization technology known as OpenVZ. This is an effective way of partitioning a Linux machine into multiple isolated Linux containers. All containers are running on top of one single Linux kernel, which results in excellent density, performance and manageability.</p>

<p>The talk gives an overall description of OpenVZ building blocks, such as namespaces, cgroups and various resource controllers. A few features, notably live migration and virtual swap, are described in greater details. Results of some performance measurements against VMware, Xen and KVM are given. Finally, we will provide a status update on merging bits and pieces of OpenVZ kernel to upstream Linux kernel, and share our plans for the future.</p>

<p>The talk is suitable for general audience, but will be of most interest to people interested in Linux kernel, resource management, virtualization, and cloud computing.</p>
