<p><p>pkgsrc is a collection of over 11,000 packages available for a variety of operating systems, developed by the NetBSD project. Since the end of 2010, there is an ongoing effort to port pkgsrc to MirOS BSD, an operating system derived from OpenBSD. This talk gives a short overview over pkgsrc, comparing its usage and features to MirPorts, the older "native" packages system on MirOS. Compared to MirPorts, pkgsrc has many more and newer packages, a more active community of developers and a very responsive security team that identifies and patches vulnerable packages. Some more practical aspects will also be treated: how to get a new platform supported in pkgsrc (both on the technical and on the administrative side) and which are the principal challenges in doing so.</p></p>
