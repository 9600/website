<p><p>XQuery has been designed by the W3C as a general purpose XML processing language.
Although XQuery is mainly known as a query language for XML collections, it is a fully fledged programming language useful in a variety of architectures and environments.
With an extremely powerful support for database queries, scripting, and full-text search, XQuery is providing a unified framework for building web applications.
The aim of this talk is to briefly introduce some of the new language features in XQuery 3.0 and demo how XQuery &amp; HTML5 can work together to build applications that are 300% awesome.</p></p>
