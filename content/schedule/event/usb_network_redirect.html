<p>Track: <a href="/schedule/track/virtualization_and_cloud_devroom">Virtualization and Cloud Devroom</a></p>

<p><p>USB redirection is using USB devices attached to a real machine inside a virtual machine (guest).
The focus of the talk will be the special case where the USB device being redirected is not attached
to the physical machine hosting the virtual machine, but to some other machine. The talk will present
and discuss the ongoing work to create an FOSS solution for this, getting this merged into upstream
qemu, as well is integrating this into Spice and the Spice-client.</p>

<p>The intended audience are people who are interested in usb in virtual machines (vusb) both
developers and users. The audience is expected to be familiar with generic virtualization concepts,
but no deep technical knowledge is required.</p></p>
<p><p>The purposes of this talk are:
* To inform people about the new USB redirection support in qemu and Spice
* Get feedback for future versions
* Hopefully get people to use Spice and maybe even become contributors</p>

<p>I gave the same talk last year, but quite a few things have changed:
* USB-2.0 support
* Integrated into Spice</p></p>
