<p><p>CacioCavallo is an award winning project sponsored by the OpenJDK porters group.</p>

<p>The main project was about refactoring of the graphics stack of OpenJDK to allow of easy porting on various platform.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s the abstract backend behind most ports and it has been used on field by commercial projects for companies in the embedded and automotive market.</p>

<p>During the last year, two new projects have landed in the official Caciocavallo repositories: CacioWeb and Cacio Testing Framework.</p>

<p>The first project allows for easy deployment even on platforms without any Java support (like Apple iPad) and makes extremely easy the deployment even without any Java plugin.</p>

<p>CacioTest aims to make easy the testing of Graphics stack, providing a reliable, unobtrusive way to run UI and graphics related tests.</p></p>
