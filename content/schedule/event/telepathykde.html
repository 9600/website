<p>Track: <a href="/schedule/track/crossdesktop_devroom">CrossDesktop Devroom</a></p>

<p><p>Telepathy is an instant messaging, Voice over IP and videoconferencing
cross-desktop framework with backends for today's most popular protocols.
Its modular and flexible architecture built around D-Bus enables developers
to easily create communications applications with interchangeable
components. A small team inside the KDE community is working on Telepathy
integration into KDE Workspaces. This talk should provide an insight into
the current state of KDE-Telepathy development, its plans and possibilities.</p></p>
<p><p>The KDE Telepathy team aims to deliver an Instant Messaging experience
fully integrated into the workspace, built on top of Telepathy
technologies. Thanks to the active upstream development of Telepathy itself
(including protocol backends), the KDE Telepathy team can better focus on
the user interfaces and their integration with Plasma Desktop. Both teams
cooperate very closely and it is great example of upstream-downstream teams
working together. This talk should briefly cover Telepathy architecture and
its current usage "in the wild", then the talk will mainly focus on
Telepathy in KDE Workspace and Applications - brief project history,
overview of ready to use components, plans for the near and far future and
examples of how to use Telepathy in existing network based applications.</p></p>
