<p>Mer says it is "aimed at device manufacturers" - but what does this mean? It has the same source as many other distros so this talk will introduce the non-code areas where Mer differentiates and how it does that by operating in the open. From systems and tools to processes; what's available, what Mer does and does not address and how a Mer-based project gets going?</p>
