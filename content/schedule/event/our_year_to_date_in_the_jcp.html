<p>Track: <a href="/schedule/track/free_java_devroom">Free Java Devroom</a></p>

<p><p>In 2011 the London Java Community (LJC) stood for, and overwhelmingly
won a seat in the open elections for a seat on the JCP Executive
Committee (JCP EC), enough acronyms yet?  We haven't even started!
It's been a whirlwind trip so far with a great deal learned about
politics, acronyms, the due diligence required on a JSR, flights to
exotic places (Jersey City!?), wrangling over the wording of a
sentence and of course launching some developer lead initiatives.</p>

<p>There have of course been some great successes in moving Free Java
forward such as the JSR-348 which is the start of reforming the JCP
and JSRs towards a truly open and transparent model.  This talk covers
the good works done so far, some anecdotes of what it's like to work
as a developer amongst a mix of technologists and bearucrats and what
we think is left to be done.</p></p>
<p><p>What the audience will learn from the talk:</p>

<p>An insight to how the JCP really works and the surprising fact that
Oracle and the other large corporates are generally pushing for a Free
Java.</p>

<p>How can people help out with the project, what feedback are you looking for?</p>

<p>We want people to start supporting the JCP again and working with it
to change it for the better, JSR-348 has proven that steps can be
taken although we recognize there is still a long way to go.</p></p>
