<p><p>Geeklog is a web content management system. The project has been around for more than 10 years now and is probably best known for powering the Groklaw website.</p></p>
<p><p>Yet another CMS? Actually, Geeklog has been around for longer than many of the other systems, yet has kept a low profile. Originally written for a security portal, security has always been our focus - to the extent of refusing certain features as long as they can not be implemented in a way that we consider secure.</p>

<p>The lightning talk will provide a quick overview of Geeklog, its features, focus, and community.</p></p>
