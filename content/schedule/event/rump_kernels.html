<p>Existing virtualization solutions such as Xen, QEMU and usermode operating systems virtualize the entire OS.  While this is useful in a machine room type of use case, it is unnecessarily heavyweight when the interest is in virtualizing only one kernel driver or one kernel service.</p>

<p>This talk introduces the anykernel architecture and rump kernels, which allow to safely virtualize individual drivers and subsystems from a monolithic kernel. Rump kernels can be used in a variety of different configurations, such as an application library, a microkernel style server, or as a server over the Internet.</p>

<p>We will go over a number of real world use cases and present results which show that in their application domain rump kernels are faster, smaller and more agile than full OS virtualization technologies.</p>
<p>The implementation is available in production quality code as part of NetBSD.  A key point of the project is the use of existing drivers from a real OS, i.e. real-world hardened code.</p>
