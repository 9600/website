<p>Track: <a href="/schedule/track/configuration_and_systems_management_devroom">Configuration and Systems Management Devroom</a></p>

<p><p>In this talk I will introduce the Matahari project, an interface for system management APIs of all kinds.</p></p>
<p><p> I will discuss the architecture of the Matahari ecosystem and how the use of AMQP as a transport layer allows it to scale to large collections of servers in the Cloud. I will also describe the ways in which developers and sysadmins can get involved in the Matahari ecosystem: by creating agents to provide access to existing APIs through Matahari; by creating their own APIs; by writing their own clients to interact with agents; and by interacting through a command line shell or script.</p></p>
