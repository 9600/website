<p>Track: <a href="/schedule/track/jabber_and_xmpp_devroom">Jabber and XMPP Devroom</a></p>

<p><p>Why Webfinger is so important, why BrowserId is so important, and how to combine the two.</p></p>
<p><p>The federated social web needs to be a tool-agnostic web. A user should be able to interact with other users, regardless of whether the other user is using xmpp-based tools, or OStatus-based tools, even SMTP, and maybe even SMS. But there is one central corner stone of socializing: user addresses. These can be email addresses, Jabber ID's, or webfinger account URIs.</p>

<p>In this talk I'll discuss some of the challenges of enabling people to own their user address. In particular, I will discuss our experiences in both the LibreDocs project and the Opentabs project, about why Webfinger is so important, why BrowserId is so important, and how to combine the two.</p></p>
