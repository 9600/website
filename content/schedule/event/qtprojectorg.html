<p><p>The Qt project was established in October to drive further development of
Qt as an open source project. The main development effort of
qt-project.org goes into Qt 5, the next major version of Qt that is
currently being developed. The talk will explain the setup of
qt-project.org, and how people can participate and contribute to the
project. It'll also give an overview over Qt 5.</p></p>
