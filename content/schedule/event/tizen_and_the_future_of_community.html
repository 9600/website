<p>This session will provide a basic intro to Tizen and will talk
about the community transition from MeeGo to Tizen. We'll do a quick recap
from past year of the MeeGo community along with some things we learned
along the way. The rest of the presentation will talk about what we are
doing to form the Tizen community and how you can participate.
I'll also gather feedback during the Q&amp;A on what you would like to see us
do differently in the Tizen community.</p>
