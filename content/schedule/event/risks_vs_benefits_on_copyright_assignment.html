<p><p>A quick analysis of the risks and benefits that copyright assignment
can bring to the Free Software ecosystem. I'll take a qualitative look
at the side-effects of assignment on the diversity of project
participants, and the knock-on impact that decisions in this area can
have on the economics of supporting Free Software development. Come and
find out how you can avoid making a mess of your community for some
rather dubiuous legal advantages.</p></p>
