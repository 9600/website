<p><p>Mozilla is building a generation of webmakers â€” people who do not consume the web, but help make it. To do this, we're teaming developers up with journalists, filmmakers, and kids around programs that show you how to bend and hack the web. We need your help to reach more people and build tools that expose the power of the web. Come learn more!</p></p>
