<p>This talk will discuss our experience at <a href="http://www.adacore.com/">AdaCore</a>, one of only a handful of 100% Free Software companies. All of our commercial products are licensed under the GPL and other Free Software Licenses.
People often assume that there is a conflict between the use of such licenses and the needs of a commercial software company. Our experience at AdaCore shows that on the contrary, the Free Software model can be very successful both for us as a company and for our customers.
We think this model can be used in many other circumstances, and want to encourage free software enthusiasts to consider this model in other circumstances.</p>
