<p><p>In this presentation, I will provide an overview of how big rewrite and
redesign efforts have affected the development of the OpenWrt project.
After showing two past examples of big structural changes, I will
introduce the current effort to redesign large parts of the OpenWrt
user space components.
This redesign aims to bring some interesting approaches from the
Desktop Linux world over to Embedded, without bringing along the
amount of bloat that is usually associated with them.</p></p>
