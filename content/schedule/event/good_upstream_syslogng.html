<p><p>For many years, syslog-ng was part of many distributions but stuck at ancient software versions. My task was to help distributions to update their syslog-ng packages and now to keep them updated. This is a two way process, as while distros receive many help, we also get a lot of useful feedback and ideas, which influence the development of syslog-ng.
Using syslog-ng as an example, I'll try to show how upstream can work with distributions for the benefit of both sides.</p></p>
