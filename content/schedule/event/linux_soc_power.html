<p><p>Due to the nature of the new SoC architectures the Power Management
needs a new model for the various system latencies.</p>

<p>The talk presents:
- the concepts of system, devices, wake-up and resume latencies,
- the recent changes in the devices framework for the latency, why and
how to make it generic,
- the recent changes in the ARM/OMAP platform code for the system latency,
- the problems encountered while modeling and measuring the various latencies,
- a proposal on the model,
- the planned changes in the device framework, the platform code and the APIs.</p>

<p>This talk is oriented towards Linux power management developers and
users. The generic model covers all flavors of Linux, from the
embedded device up to the multi processor computing server.</p></p>
