<p><p>The Pandora is a handheld produced to run Linux. It's not only a gaming device (it features gaming controls), but basically a full Mini-Linux PC the size of a Nintendo DS. It has come a long ways and many many issues occurred during the production. The mass production will finally start in Germany in February, making it easily available for everyone. This talk will give a small introduction to those who don't know what the Pandora is, explaining a bit about the history and the community behind it as well as showing what it can do.</p></p>
