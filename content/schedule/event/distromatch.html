<p>Track: <a href="/schedule/track/crossdistribution_devroom">CrossDistribution Devroom</a></p>

<p><p>At the <a href="http://distributions.freedesktop.org/wiki/Meetings/AppInstaller2011">AppInstaller2011</a> meeting I started writing <a href="http://www.enricozini.org/2011/debian/distromatch/">Distromatch</a> which is able to map binary package names across different distribution using a wide set of euristics.</p>

<p>Distromatch has the potential of being a radical change in cross-distro cooperation, enabling exchange of package screenshots, categories, ratings, reviews and many other interesting kinds of metadata.</p>

<p>Since distromatch has existed for almost a year and (afaik) so far none of this has happened, I am taking advantage of the cross-distro room to show how it works and discuss how to move on from here.</p></p>
