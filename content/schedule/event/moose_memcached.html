<p><p>2dehands/2ememain uses Memcached for caching Moose objects. We use MooseX::Storage for this, and have extended it in some interesting
ways.</p></p>
<p><p>We deal with issues such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>We cannot flush the cache, so we need an upgrade path for new object versions.</li>
<li>We wanted to isolate some changes that are normaly global settings.</li>
</ul>


<p>In this talk Marius will describe how they use Moose with Memcached and show how they used the standard Moose/MOP tools to extend MooseX::Storage to support their needs.</p></p>
