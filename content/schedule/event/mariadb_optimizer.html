<p>A typical recent version of a MySQL-based product focuses on letting you run the same queries on more CPU cores, or having better replication. MariaDB 5.3 is very different: its focus is the new query optimizer features that let you run queries that were traditionally considered off-limits for MySQL.</p>
<p>MariaDB 5.3 is getting stable: 5.3.3 Release Candidate has been released in December, and one can expect another, almost? stable release in January or February.</p>

<p>This talk will show: - What kinds of traditionally no-no queries are now okay to run, - What optimizations are used to execute them, - How the new optimizations behave for typical kinds queries and popular</p>

<pre><code>benchmark suites. 
</code></pre>

<p>In conclusion, we will discuss relationship with other MySQL branches: which of these new optimizations will also be in MySQL 5.6, what are the differences between MySQL and MariaDB variants, and what one can expect to see in Percona server.</p>
