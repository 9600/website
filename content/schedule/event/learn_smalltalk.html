<p>Track: <a href="/schedule/track/smalltalk_devroom">Smalltalk Devroom</a></p>

<p><p>A lot of the things in software engineering we take for granted these days are rooted in Smalltalk.
But most people do not program in Smalltalk. Do you wonder if there are more pieces of brilliance in Smalltalk waiting to be picked up by
the general computing community? Come and experience yourself.</p>

<p>We'll work with you through an exercise showing Seaside, Glamour and other little known treasures, fully exploiting the 'objects-all-the-way'
attitude visible in the Pharo open source Smalltalk environment.</p>

<p>Bring your laptop to pair through the exercises. Take home a web application, deployed on your laptop.</p></p>
