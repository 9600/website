<p>Track: <a href="/schedule/track/crossdistribution_devroom">CrossDistribution Devroom</a></p>

<p><p>Gentoo uses versioning in the package manager script format. EAPI is the contract between ebuilds (Gentoo's packaging scripts) and the package manager. The version currently in use is 4.</p>

<p>This session is about looking over features in the pipeline for the next version and hopefully having a discussion on them and others. Traditionally multiple council members have attended FOSDEM so this is your chance to influence the technical direction of Gentoo package management.</p></p>
