<p><p>Come and join us for the release of the Open Advice book.
Open Advice is a collaboration of people from many different Free
Software projects answering one question: What's one key thing you
would have liked to know when you started contributing. We will give a
short tour of the book and talk about some of the lessons learned from
taking a large-scale book project from idea to publishing.</p></p>
