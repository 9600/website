<p>Track: <a href="/schedule/track/libreoffice_devroom">LibreOffice Devroom</a></p>

<p><p>TDF provides not only a stable and reliable software to its users, but also a stable and reliable infrastructure for its community. Contrary to what we had before, most of the knowledge is now inside the community, giving a flexible and scalable solution that grows with the demands of the project. This talk gives an overview on the infrastructure that drives the LibreOffice community, including technical details on server administration and management.</p></p>
