<p>Track: <a href="/schedule/track/crossdistribution_devroom">CrossDistribution Devroom</a></p>

<p><p>Testing is an important task. But testing daily development-snapshots of a Linux-distribution would mean testing the same things every day, which would be pretty tiresome to testers. Yet, no one likes to break his system with untested code.</p>

<p>This presentation will be about my solution to this problem, using automated testing with KVM or VirtualBox for openQA.openSUSE.org to guarantee some minimum quality.  This will show some unique features like audio-testing, GUI-testing, and support for multiple distributions like Debian, Archlinux and Fedora. It will also have installation videos which are cool, fun and useful.</p></p>
