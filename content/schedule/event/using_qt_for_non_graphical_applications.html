<p><p>The Qt framework is best known by most developers as a graphical
toolkit library, which allows to build graphical interfaces with
windows, buttons, checkboxes and drop-down lists.</p>

<p>However, Qt is not limited to graphical application development and
through this talk, we would like to highlight the multiple features
that Qt offers to embedded Linux developers developping non-graphical
applications.</p>

<p>Based on the experience of a real non-graphical application developped
for a customer, we will detail how Qt has helped integrating features
such as communication with multiple devices over serial ports,
communication with a GSM modem, XML parsing, HTTP requests,
communication with Linux input devices, and more.</p></p>
