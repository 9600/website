<p><p>One part of the integration of upstream software in a distribution is to correctly deal with changes that have a wide impact, either because they affect a lot of other software, or because the changes will be highly visible to the users. And it is easy to feel that such changes are always going wrong: some applications stop working, many users complain about the change they feel was uncalled for, nearly nobody shares a thank you note.</p>

<p>Such wide-impact changes always come with controversies, and being the bridge between users and upstreams, distributions are the place where all the rage is going on, with a social aspect that is usually at least as important as the technical side of things.</p>

<p>The recent years have not been exempt of controversies, and we will share our experiences with user-visible changes such as the move to KDE 4, GNOME 3 and systemd.</p>

<p>This talk will be co-presented by the SUSE Gang: Frédéric Crozat, Will Stephenson, Vincent Untz.</p></p>
