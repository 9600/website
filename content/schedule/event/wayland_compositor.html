<p><p>Neil and Robert will discuss their own experience of writing a Wayland compositor, where they have been adaping the Gnome Mutter compositor
into a hybrid X and Wayland compositor. The talk aims to provide general guidance on writing a hybrid X and Wayland compositor without
going into many Mutter specifics.</p></p>
