<p><p>SVG 1.1 is now widely implemented, and has some (minimal, optional) support for ICC colours. In the main though it is an sRGB system. SVG2 adds a conformance class for full ICC support (v2 and v4) including named colours, direct specification in LAB or LCHab, and interpolation in LAB or LCHab. Unmanaged device-specific colour is also supported.</p></p>
