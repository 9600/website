<h3>Bio</h3>
<p><p>I am a professional, working in the field of the Internet. I have wide experience in the development of products and with the new trends of the global network.</p>

<p>I am dealing with communities since 2004 when I started organizing a Web technology conference. It was important back then as it is now to find proper approach to reach the different community layers. The Combination between on and offline methods helps strengthening its integrity.</p></p>
