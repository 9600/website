<h3>Bio</h3>
<p><p>Daniel Vetter has been an avid user of Linux since more than ten years. But only a few years ago he switched from lurker to contributor when the graphics stack rewrite broke his old laptop and all the developers were busy fixing newer machines. From then on it went all downhill and since half a year ago he's enjoying the fun and frustration of working on the Linux graphics driver stack professionally at Intel's OTC.</p></p>
