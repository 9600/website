<h3>Bio</h3>
<p><p>Mario is a Computer Engineer and a partner of Igalia, an European Free
Software and Open Source consultancy company, which he started working
at six years ago, back in February 2006.</p>

<p>Since early 2010, he joined the WebKit team inside Igalia to work on
improving the accessibility support in WebKitGTK+ using the AT-SPI
interfaces and the ATK library, so Assistive Technologies (ATs) like
Orca (GNOME's screen reader) to access the information exposed through
WebKitGTK+ based applications.</p>

<p>Nowadays, Mario devotes most of his time to make WebKit2GTK+ (the port
of WebKit2 for GTK+) provide accessibility support, which is an
interesting challenge due to the multi-process architecture of WebKit2.</p>

<p>Other than work related stuff, Mario loves photography, music and
spending some quality time with his family whenever it's possible.
