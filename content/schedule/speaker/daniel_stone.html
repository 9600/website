<h3>Bio</h3>
<p><p>Daniel was tricked into packaging X ten years ago, and has been working on input for the past few years, including maintaining (loosely speaking) the X keyboard code, and authoring the original input hotplug implementation.  He's still sorry about the HAL support in the X server, still has not forgiven those responsible for tricking him into packaging X in the first place, and can kill any conversation with boring did-you-knows about keyboards.</p></p>
