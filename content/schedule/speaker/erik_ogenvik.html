<h3>Bio</h3>
<p><p>Erik began coding for the Worldforge project as a way to learn C++, but quickly got hooked on the allure of free and open virtual world technology. He's mainly focused on the client side of virtual world building, especially the Ember client. Trying to present an unconstrained world to the users gives rise to a series of unique problems, especially when it comes to presenting it graphically. Trying to solve these is the main driving force behind his involvement.</p></p>
