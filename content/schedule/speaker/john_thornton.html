<h3>Bio</h3>
<p><p>JohnnyT (a.k.a. John Thornton) has been developing web applications
for 15 years, the last 7 of which have been in Ruby. He was converted
to Smalltalk in 2010 after looking into MagLev
<a href="http://maglev.github.com/">http://maglev.github.com/</a> and discovering the magical world of
GemStone/S <a href="http://www.gemstone.com/products/gemstone">http://www.gemstone.com/products/gemstone</a> powering it
all. He started a local Utah Smalltalk Users Group (USMUG) to help him
in his quest to share the joy of Smalltalk with everyone he can. He
works on Amber and SubWars (an open-source GPS browser based submarine
game) to scratch his Smalltalk itch and earns his living working for
Alliance Health Networks in Salt Lake City, Utah.</p></p>
