<h3>Bio</h3>
<p><p>I'm a hacker, programmer, software developer. I am 42, originally from Finland, and now live in Manchester, UK. I've been programming computers since 1984. I read the GNU Manifesto in 1986, but didn't really become interested in software freedom until 1988, when I got into university and got access to the Internet.</p>

<p>While at university I got involved in kicking off Linux, co-founding the Linux Documentation Project and writing one of their initial books, co-moderating comp.os.linux.announce, joining the Debian project, generally messing about. Since then, I've worked in a number of places, doing all sorts of hackery kinds of things, such as database engine development, language design and implementation,
embedded development, Internet server development, etc. I have had a ton of personal projects, too, some of which have been released.
My current personal project is Obnam, a backup program.</p>

<p>The one long-term constant has been my participation in the Debian project as a package maintainer. I've done a bunch of different things for Debian, and generally poked my nose in places. This has
given me a good sense of the job of developing and maintaining a large Linux distribution.</p>

<p>I now work for Codethink, in Manchester. We do many kinds of software development for clients. Last year, we started a new embedded systems project, Baserock, in which we try to solve all the problems we see with the way Linux embedded development is currently done.</p>
