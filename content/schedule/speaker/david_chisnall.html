<h3>Bio</h3>
<p><p>David Chisnall is an active contributor to a number of Free Software projects.  He is responsible for Objective-C support for non-Apple platforms in Clang and has contributed to several other parts of the compiler.  He is the original author of libcxxrt, which provides the low-level C++ ABI support.  Libcxxrt was developed for PathScale and was open sourced by the FreeBSD and NetBSD Foundations and will form the base of the new C++ stack in FreeBSD 10.</p>

<p>Under sponsorship from the FreeBSD Foundation, he implemented the missing parts of FreeBSD's libc to support libc++ and ported libc++ to FreeBSD.  After this work, libc++ passed more of its test suite on FreeBSD than on Darwin, where it was originally developed.</p>

<p>He is also an active contributor to the GNUstep project, including being the author and maintainer of the GNUstep Objective-C runtime.  He is a member of the core team of the Étoilé project, which aims to build a desktop environment on top of GNUstep.  His contributions to this project include a framework for easily implementing dynamic languages and a Smalltalk compiler that is ABI-compatible with Objective-C built on top of this framework.  He was invited to give a talk at the 2011 International Smalltalk Conference about this implementation.  A full list of his open source contributions is available from <a href="https://www.ohloh.net/accounts/theraven">Ohloh</a>.</p>

<p>David Chisnall is the author of several books:  The Definitive Guide to the Xen Hypervisor, Cocoa Programming: Developer's Handbook, Objective-C Phrasebook, and Go Phrasebook.</p></p>
