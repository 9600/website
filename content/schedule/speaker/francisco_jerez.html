<h3>Bio</h3>
<p><p>After his unsuccessful experience as a student and political activist in the last few years, Francisco Jerez got involved with the development of the reverse-engineered Nouveau driver and some of its surrounding parts in the Linux graphics stack.  Right now he's doing his best to get Gallium3D's GPGPU support to finally take off.</p></p>
