<h3>Bio</h3>
<p><p>It was mid 2005 when a good friend tol me "Hey come and see this! It's called Asterisk and you can make calls with it! It uses a protocol called SIP and..." Since then I've been working on VoIP and liking it more every day. I also love IM and gadgets... everything that I can make 'talk'.</p></p>
<p><p>Currently working at AG Projects, I've been working on the development python-sipsimple (http://sipsimpleclient.com), Blink (http://icanblink.com), SylkServer (http://sylkserver.com) and related projects.</p></p>
