<h3>Bio</h3>
<p><p>Manik Surtani is a core R&amp;D engineer at JBoss, a division of Red Hat. He is the founder of the Infinispan project, which he currently leads, and also leads the JBoss Cache project.</p>

<p>His interests lie in cloud and distributed computing, autonomous systems and highly available computing. He has a background in artificial intelligence and neural networks, a field he left behind when he moved from academic circles to the commercial world. Since then, he's been working with Java-related technologies, first for a startup focusing on knowledge management and information exchange, and later for a large London-based consultancy as a tech lead focused on e-commerce applications on large Java EE and peer-to-peer technology.</p>

<p>Surtani is a strong proponent of open source development methodologies, ethos, and collaborative processes, and has been involved in open source since his first forays into computing.</p></p>
