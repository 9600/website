<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>John started working with GNU Press and the Free Software Foundation in
2003 and then became the FSF's first Campaigns Manager, working on
outreach efforts like Defective by Design, BadVista, and PlayOgg. In
2011, John became the Executive Director after four years as Manager of
Operations.</p>

<p>His background is mainly in the humanities, with an MFA in Writing and
Poetics and a BA in Philosophy, but he has been spending too much time
with computers and online communities since the days of the Commodore
64. He's become a dedicated GNU Emacs user after first trying it around
1996, and contributes code to several of its extensions.</p>

<p>Prior to the FSF, John worked as a college debate team instructor for
both Harvard and Michigan State University.</p>
