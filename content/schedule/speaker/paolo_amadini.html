<h3>Bio</h3>
<p><p>Paolo Amadini finds it's really hard to come up with something
meaningful for explaining what he's been doing in the Free and Open
Source Software world in the last few years. Especially when writing
in the third person!</p>

<p>Thus he'll only mention he's been volunteering as a developer in
Mozilla for the last three years. Starting this year, he also works as
a consultant in the Firefox engineering team.</p></p>
