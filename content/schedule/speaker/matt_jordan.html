<h3>Bio</h3>
<p><p>Matt Jordan is a Software Developer with the Open Source Software team at Digium, working on Asterisk.  Matt joined the team in 2011, and since then has been involved in various portions of Asterisk and Asterisk Test Suite development.  His background in software development can best be described as "eclectic", having worked in a variety of industries.  Uniting the various experiences, however, is a firm belief in good software development practices and methodologies and the effect they have on producing quality software (and keeping software developers from going insane).</p></p>
