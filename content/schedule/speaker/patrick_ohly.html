<h3>Bio</h3>
<p><p>In a past life, Patrick has worked on performance analysis software for HPC clusters ("Intel Trace Analyzer and Collector") and cluster technology in general (PTP and hardware time stamping, included in Linux since
 2.6.30). Since January 2009 he works for Intel's Open Source
 Technology on data synchronization+storage and more specifically
 SyncEvolution, originally his spare time project since 2005.</p>

<p> In parallel to his work on commercial, closed source software
 Patrick has often contributed to free and open source software
 (including Evolution, mkisofs, doxygen, Roundup, gpsbabel, fcron,
 UAE) before he started is own SyncEvolution project. Patrick started
 his love/hate relationship with computers in his teens on the
 Commodore 64 and (more seriously) the Amiga, for which he wrote both
 public domain programs (DiskProtection) and shareware
 (MakeCD). Later he studied Computer Science in Karlsruhe and
 Edinburgh before working for Nero, Pallas and then Intel.</p></p>
