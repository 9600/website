<h3>Bio</h3>
<p><p>I've been involved in the Mono project for almost 10 years. I started as a contributor, and then joined Ximian (later Novell) to work full time on Mono. I'm the author of Mono's remoting, serialization and web services libraries, although most of my work has been focused on the MonoDevelop IDE. Nowadays I'm employed at Xamarin and I keep working on the MonoDevelop project.</p></p>
