<h3>Bio</h3>
<p><p>Bart "Stecchino" Cerneels is a long time Amarok contributor that has
recently made it to the Authors list. Despite being honored with that
title he still has to work for a living as a freelance software
architect. In his spare time he keeps on finding stuff to do in his
eternally unfinished self-build solar passive zero-energy house and
taking care of 2 cats and a fiancee.</p></p>
