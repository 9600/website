<h3>Bio</h3>
<p><p>R. Tyler Croy has been involved with the Jenkins project for longer than he remembers. While actively avoiding writing any Java, he's been involved in evangelizing through the @jenkinsci Twitter account and managing as much Jenkins project infrastructure as time permits. By day, he works for Lookout, Inc., by night he works for the suave butler with the red bowtie.</p></p>
