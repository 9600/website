<h3>Bio</h3>
<p><p>About me: I am currently working as an independent consultant. My company based in the Netherlands is called Living Software B.V. I assist organisations in delivering valuable software early and continuously.
I develop software, help clients develop software and train groups of software developers and managers (http://www.experienceagile.eu) co-organize agile open http://www.agileopen.net and have co-organised sessions on XP2001, XP2004, various XP days, Agile200*(5,6,7) and OT2002,3,4.
I enjoy creating collaborative learning experiences. Follow my weblog if you're interested in recent developments and upcoming events: http://me.andering.com</p></p>
