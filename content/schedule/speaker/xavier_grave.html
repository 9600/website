<h3>Bio</h3>
<p><p>Xavier Grave got his PhD in theoretical physics in 1997 but learned programming by himself as early as 1984 and learned Ada with GNAT and the Lovelace tutorial in 1997. The following year, he joined the CNRS, where he is now developing in Ada a highly distributed acquisition system: NARVAL. In 2005 he started translating SOS (Simple Operating System) into Ada and extending it to a full distributed operating system. He is also active in the Ada-France association.</p></p>
