<h3>Bio</h3>
<p><p>Jesse has been an active OSS and Linux contributer for many years now. His first real pushes started with some KDE and XMMS work on IRIX; but shortly thereafter he moved to working on Linux scalability and platform support for high-end SGI Altix servers.  He now works at Intel with a focus on the Linux graphics stack (with a side of Linux PCI maintenance), and has recently started work on Wayland-related projects.</p></p>
