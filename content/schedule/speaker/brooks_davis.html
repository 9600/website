<h3>Bio</h3>
<p><p>Brooks Davis has been a FreeBSD user since 1994, a FreeBSD committer since 2001, and a core team member since 2006. He has also contributed to the Ganglia and Sun Grid Engine projects.
He earned a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science from Harvey Mudd College in 1998. His computing interests include high performance computing, networking, security, mobility, and, of course, finding ways to use FreeBSD in all these areas.
When not computing, he enjoys reading, cooking, brewing, introducing people to the pleasures of Slow Food, and pounding on red-hot iron in his garage blacksmith shop.</p></p>
