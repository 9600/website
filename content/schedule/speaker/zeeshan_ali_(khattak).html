<h3>Bio</h3>
<p><p>Zeeshan Ali is a Free Software developer who works at Red Hat Inc. He is originally from Pakistan but has been living in Finland for the past six years. He is one of the core developers of Boxes, GUPnP and Rygel projects and contributes to other Free Software projects every now and then. When he is not hacking, he is probably watching some sci-fi or playing Battlefield on his PS3, trying desperately to hide that he is a rookie.</p></p>
