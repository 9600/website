<h3>Bio</h3>
<p><p>Jeffrey Gehlbach helps organizations use free software to manage systems and networks.  It's a good thing, therefore, that he has a diverse background in IP network engineering, UNIX and Linux systems administration, systems and network management, and free software. He's lucky enough to work as Principal Consultant for The OpenNMS Group, the commercial services company that sponsors the OpenNMS project, and has been a member of the Order of the Green Polo since 2006.</p></p>
