<h3>Bio</h3>
<p><p>Mike McClurg joined Citrix in 2010 to work on XenServer's management toolstack, and he soon became involved with the open source XCP project. Mike is a functional programming languages geek, and joined the XenServer toolstack team not because of Xen, but because the toolstack is written in OCaml, a high-performance functional language. He currently lives in Cambridge, UK.</p></p>
