<h3>Bio</h3>
<p><p>I'm Kristian Høgsberg, I work at Intel in the graphics team in the Open Source Technology Center.  I'm the founder and maintainer of the Wayland project and it's what I work on at Intel. I've been at Intel for two and a half years.  In the past I've worked at Red Hat, mainly in the X/Desktop team where I did AIGLX and DRI2. Overall, I've been working on Linux graphics and window systems for almost 8 years now.
I've always been excited about driving improvement and simplification in the Linux graphics stack across the various open source silos and tribes.</p></p>
