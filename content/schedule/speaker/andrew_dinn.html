<h3>Bio</h3>
<p><p>Andrew Dinn began work in industrial and academic software development and research in 1984, a year after obtaining his BA in Mathematics and Philosophy. He has been lucky enough to be involved in a wide range of projects covering virtual machines, compilers, parallel programming, logic programming, rule engines, transaction managers, graphics renderers, distributed applications, realtime systems, etc. Even more luckily, always as a programmer and never as a project manager. Andrew currently works for Red Hat as a member of the Java team, located in sunny Newcastle Upon Tyne, England.</p></p>
