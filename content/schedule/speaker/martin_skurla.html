<h3>Bio</h3>
<p><p>I am student, software engineer and Java enthusiast. I like playing with code and libraries on the Java platform. Currently focusing on Groovy and Scala as well. I am a big fan of NetBeans, both the IDE and platform as well. I like especially "low level" stuff in Java - annotation processing, AST manipulations, class loading, garbage collection, concurrency, build tools.</p></p>
