<h3>Bio</h3>
<p><p>Martin Peres is a French security engineer from the ENSI de Bourges and a PhD student at LaBRI. His research topic is on security &amp; power consumption in wireless networks.</p>

<p>Martin started programming at the age of 12 and mostly wrote open source projects so as others could learn from his experience. However his involvement became political when he was introduced to GNU and finally switched on Arch Linux in 2007.</p>

<p>Martin started being interested in the Linux graphic stack because his ATI xpress 200M wasn't working at all which lead him to often recompile his kernel to test the latest drm-next commits. He later got a laptop donated by his engineering school to every student which got him into Nouveau. This ultimately led him to spend most of his free-time during the last 1.5 years working on power management for Geforce 8+ GPUs.</p>

<p>On a side note, Martin is also the co-author of a Qt-based IDE for the open-source arduino platform.</p>

<p>Finally, Martin is an active member of a hackerspace in his town called labx where he hopes to develop a fast and very accurate power meter.</p></p>
