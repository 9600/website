<h3>Bio</h3>
<p><p>Michiel de Jong has worked as tech support, researcher, sysadmin and programmer in the areas of hosting, artificial intelligence and scalability. Last year, he quit his job and moved, with his laptop, to a tropical island, with the goal of writing free software to fight the web's monopolies. Since that day, he has been living the dream of full-time freedom hacker, thanks to kind donations from followers of the Unhosted project.</p></p>
