<h3>Bio</h3>
<p><p>Software engineering has been my passion for 30+ years, through many exciting projects notably at French Civil Aviation, Schlumberger, Alcatel, Sun Microsystems.
Software development on Optical Music Recognition began as a hobby, and went on for several years, besides my day job at Sun. Beginning of 2011, I left Sun and created Audiveris company to now work full-time on Audiveris OMR software.
[A long time ago, I graduated from Ecole polytechnique (X72) and ENAC (Ecole Nationale de l'Aviation Civile)]</p></p>
