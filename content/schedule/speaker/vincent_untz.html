<h3>Bio</h3>
<p><p>When he's not procrastinating or eating ice cream, Vincent Untz shows his real face: he is an active Free Software enthusiast, GNOME lover, and advocate, and openSUSE Booster.
When describing his contributions, Vincent finds it easier to declare he is a "touche-Ã -tout", having worked on various (some say random) areas of the desktop: code, release management, promotion, foundation administration, bug triage, specifications...
Vincent is working at SUSE.</p></p>
