<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>Bradley M. Kuhn began his work in the Free Software Movement as a
volunteer when, in 1992, he became an early adopter of the popular
GNU/Linux operating system, and began contributing to various Free
Software projects. He worked during the 1990s as a system
administrator and software development consultant for Westinghouse,
Lucent Technologies, and numerous small companies. He also spent one
year teaching Advanced Placement Computer Science (using GNU/Linux and
GCC) at Walnut Hills High School in Cincinnati. In January 2000, he
was hired by the Free Software Foundation (FSF), and he served as its
Executive Director from March 2001 until March 2005, when he left FSF
to join the Software Freedom Law Center (SFLC), where he worked as
SFLC's Policy Analyst and Technology Director from 2005 until October
2010, when he joined Software Freedom Conservancy as its Executive
Director. Kuhn holds a summa cum laude B.S. in Computer Science from
Loyola College in Maryland, and an M.S. in Computer Science from the
University of Cincinnati. His Master's thesis discussed methods for
