SUMMARY:Coping with wide-impact changes in a distribution
DESCRIPTION: One part of the integration of upstream software in a distribution is to correctly deal with changes that have a wide impact, either because they affect a lot of other software, or because the changes will be highly visible to the users. And it is easy to feel that such changes are always going wrong: some applications stop working, many users complain about the change they feel was uncalled for, nearly nobody shares a thank you note.Such wide-impact changes always come with controversies, and being the bridge between users and upstreams, distributions are the place where all the rage is going on, with a social aspect that is usually at least as important as the technical side of things.The recent years have not been exempt of controversies, and we will share our experiences with user-visible changes such as the move to KDE 4, GNOME 3 and systemd.This talk will be co-presented by the SUSE Gang: Frédéric Crozat, Will Stephenson, Vincent Untz.

SUMMARY:How to replace a legacy tool with 100k installations
DESCRIPTION: Debian has a number of legacy tools (that's a euphemism for ugly hacks) that are not addressed due to inertia, fear of breaking stuff, and the difficulty of reaching consensus for changes with cross-package impact. I'll talk about dealing with the above issues in the context of ongoing work as part of Debian Enhancement Proposal 9.Specifically, the talk will cover how (not) to make proposals for cross-package changes, and how to map behaviour in a technical spec to feature-centered assertions in a test suite.

SUMMARY:Multiarch - why it's important
DESCRIPTION: Multiarch is a properly generic solution to the installation and use of library packages from one than one architecture at a time, which changes the way running non-native binaries and crossbuilding are dealt with in a fundamental way. It is both powerful and intrusive and has taken a long time to make happen.This talk explains what it is, how it works, and what you can do with it. We will also discuss future adoption by other distros.

SUMMARY:OpenQA
DESCRIPTION: Testing is an important task. But testing daily development-snapshots of a Linux-distribution would mean testing the same things every day, which would be pretty tiresome to testers. Yet, no one likes to break his system with untested code.This presentation will be about my solution to this problem, using automated testing with KVM or VirtualBox for openQA.openSUSE.org to guarantee some minimum quality.  This will show some unique features like audio-testing, GUI-testing, and support for multiple distributions like Debian, Archlinux and Fedora. It will also have installation videos which are cool, fun and useful.

SUMMARY:QA tools for FOSS distributions
DESCRIPTION: FOSS distributions are increasingly over pressure to deliver stable releases including the most up to date upstream software. Time-based release strategies has exacerbated this problem putting even more pressure on QA teams.The recently concluded Mancoosi project has developed a number of tools to automatically analyse large packages collections for a range of problems, frominstallability checks to speculative analysis of software repositories.In this talk I'll present four command line tools to identify and correct potential problems as soon as possible during the release cycle.

SUMMARY:Gentoo EAPI 5
DESCRIPTION: Gentoo uses versioning in the package manager script format. EAPI is the contract between ebuilds (Gentoo's packaging scripts) and the package manager. The version currently in use is 4.This session is about looking over features in the pipeline for the next version and hopefully having a discussion on them and others. Traditionally multiple council members have attended FOSDEM so this is your chance to influence the technical direction of Gentoo package management.

SUMMARY:I wrote Distromatch, shall we use it?
DESCRIPTION: At the [AppInstaller2011](http://distributions.freedesktop.org/wiki/Meetings/AppInstaller2011) meeting I started writing [Distromatch](http://www.enricozini.org/2011/debian/distromatch/) which is able to map binary package names across different distribution using a wide set of euristics.Distromatch has the potential of being a radical change in cross-distro cooperation, enabling exchange of package screenshots, categories, ratings, reviews and many other interesting kinds of metadata.Since distromatch has existed for almost a year and (afaik) so far none of this has happened, I am taking advantage of the cross-distro room to show how it works and discuss how to move on from here.

SUMMARY:Debtags.debian.net reloaded!
DESCRIPTION: I have just finished redesigning the Debtags website, consolidating a 9 years long history of bringing categories to a large and complex distribution like Debian.There is more to Debtags than meets the eye: interesting library science concepts, anonymous submissions, an efficient review workflow, a fully automated tagging engine, dynamically generated tagging hints, fancy tag search algorithms.On top of that, there is not much that is Debian-specific in the new codebase, so if you are interested in implementing categories on your distribution of choice, this could give you quite a head start.

SUMMARY:Being a good upstream - the syslog-ng PoV
DESCRIPTION: For many years, syslog-ng was part of many distributions but stuck at ancient software versions. My task was to help distributions to update their syslog-ng packages and now to keep them updated. This is a two way process, as while distros receive many help, we also get a lot of useful feedback and ideas, which influence the development of syslog-ng.Using syslog-ng as an example, I'll try to show how upstream can work with distributions for the benefit of both sides.

SUMMARY:Working with contributor communities (round table)
DESCRIPTION: Several distribution projects have existing initiatives and programs in order to coordinate and/or fund local communities as well as shipping or producing promotional material, going to events to promote the project, etc...Some projects are currently looking into setting up something like this, and others are rethinking their current model.Those programs all have their differences, but achieve pretty similar goals.In this session, we will bring together a bunch of people from different projects who are in charge or actively participating in such initiatives, in order to briefly present what they are currently doing in their project and, more importantly, share experience about what has worked well and what hasn't in an open discussion session.Let's learn from each others' ideas and mistakes.

DESCRIPTION: Presenting tools and workflows used via Open Build Service by various distributions to develop the distribution. This includes automated source processing, validation, QA, automated and manual reviews.Additional focus point on maintenance handling, means updates after a distribution is released which are usually done in a complete different way.I like to have a discussion about the question how distributions should validate trustable sources and how the trust can be increased by a common distro effort.

SUMMARY:Submission Review with Open Build Service
DESCRIPTION: A reliable and transparent, high volume package review infrastructure was implemented with the [Open Build Service (OBS)](http://openbuildservice.org/). In OBS, a software package can travel through several projects. Submission Review is done at project specific gates to control such travel.The openSUSE:Factory project currently defines review gates for license compliance, security and packaging. Together with an issue tracking system we create a community friendly ecosystem that implements project policies. Centralized gatekeepers or dedicated review periods are eliminated. Propagation delay is minimized.With OBS providing the hooks to add review authorities, we were able to code most of the respective business logic with python scripts, reusing and extending the osc command line tool as a feature-rich layer ontop of the OBS API.This talk describes the openSUSE project review process and how it helps various stakeholders to excercise their control, using the legal team as a non-trivial example.

SUMMARY:Debian Secrets - what I wish I knew before joining Debian
DESCRIPTION: Debian is usually advertised as a volunteer project with a subtle mix of democracy and do-ocracy. While this is correct, implementation details are mostly undocumented, and it is often difficult for prospective or relatively new contributors to really understand the inner workings of the project.This talk will detail some useful lessons, and also some secrets about Debian learned over the years. It is hoped that it will be helpful to people willing to get things done in Debian.
