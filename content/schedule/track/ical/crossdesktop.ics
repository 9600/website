SUMMARY:GStreamer 1.0 - the next generation of your favourite multimedia framework
DESCRIPTION: GStreamer is a highly versatile plugin-based multimedia framework thatprovides abstractions to cater for a whole range of multimedia needs,whether desktop applications, streaming servers or multimediamiddleware; embedded systems, desktops or server farms.GStreamer 1.0 is the next generation of the successful GStreamer 0.10.xAPI series where some of the core API has got a complete overhaul toaddress many of the limitations we have run into over the years with theold API. In many respects, 1.0 will be pretty much the same as 0.10, butin others it will be radically different.This talk is a high-level overview of what's been happening in the worldof GStreamer as of late, with a special focus on the status of GStreamer1.0, highlighting some of the improvements it will bring.

SUMMARY:CMake the build tool that does more than you think it can
DESCRIPTION: Bill Hoffman, the original CMake developer, and Alexander Neundorf thearchitect of the KDE CMake Build system will talk about the full capabilities of CMake as abuild tool. They will cover both the basics of getting started with CMake, and some really coolfeatures that allow for the cross platform building of entire packages of software. This will bedemonstrated with example projects using the gtk as well as the Qt toolkit. They will also givesome interesting historical notes on CMake. Covered topics will include:* The basics* Debugging your CMake build system* Integrating 3rd party packages in the build using ExternalProject* Creating source and binary packages using CPack* Continuous Integration testing with CDash/CTest and cdash@home* Installing your CMake-based library - exporting and importing targets* Cross-platform scripting with CMake (cmake -E, cmake -P, file(DOWNLOAD ...) )* Lots of fun historical notes on the development of CMake and the KDE CMake buildsystem

SUMMARY:Why Java for Linux Applications?
DESCRIPTION: I've written a modest desktop application to manage my Altus Metrumrocketry electronics. The first implementation used C and Gtk+. Ieventually gave up on that implementation and started over using Javaand Swing. The application now consists of about 25kloc using acollection of external java packages for things like speech synthesis,graphing and mapping. This presentation will describe what my experiencewith Gtk+ was like and why I was motivated to start over.

SUMMARY:Tumbler - A Modern D-Bus Thumbnail Service
DESCRIPTION: Tumbler is a D-Bus service that generates thumbnails for various kindsof applications. Clients can pick from several schedulers and thumbnailflavors depending on their needs. Tumbler provides a plugin interfacevia which the list of supported file types can be extended. It alreadyships thumbnail plugins for videos, fonts, images, ODF documents, PDF/PS documents and RAW images. Thanks to its support for delegating thumbnail request to specialized third-party services, Tumbler can alsobe used with closed source thumbnail generators.Originally written for Xfce and its Thunar file manager, Tumbler waslater integrated in MeeGo and is now used on the N9 as well. In thistalk, I will explain the features, design, and usage of Tumbler as wellas its current limitations. The ultimate goal is to make application anddesktop developers aware of it and motivate them to adopt Tumbler intheir software. The talk will include a live demonstration.

SUMMARY:GNOME 3.4 accessible: Status, news, future
DESCRIPTION: In GNOME, accessibility is a core value that touches all aspects ofthe system. [1]From the infrastructure, to the graphical toolkit, to theapplications, to the assistive technologies, accessibility has been acentral consideration from the very early days.On April 2011 GNOME 3.0 was released, and although GNOME and theaccessibility made a huge effort, the accessibility support was notideal. But not are bad news. Finally the accessibility technologiesare starting to be used from the two main free desktops. AT-SPI isstarting to be used on KDE distros, and Orca is starting to befunctional with Qt apps. Since GNOME 3.0 a big effort was done inorder to improve the situation. At the moment of this proposal writingan ATK/AT-SPI2 hackfest is being organized, in order to fix the issuesfrom the framework itself.The purpose of this presentation is explaining:  * Introduce accessibility on GNOME.  * Briefly explain the status towards GNOME 3.4  * Summarize the output of the ATK/AT-SPI2 hackfest  * Compare GNOME 3.0 vs GNOME 3.4  * KDE status and cooperation  * Future[1] http://library.gnome.org/devel/accessibility-devel-guide/nightly/gad-how-it-works.html.en

SUMMARY:Toolkits on Wayland - how we're doing!
DESCRIPTION: Wayland is a next generation display manager that is hopefully thefuture for graphics in the Free Desktop. It provides an opportunity toavoid some of the historical baggage associated with X - and enablesmoother and more flexible user experiences.In this talk i'll show of the status quo of various toolkits runningon Wayland - including GTK+, Clutter, Mx and with a special guestappearance from Tiago Vignatti to show off the state of the QT port.We'll talk about what works and what doesn't and what applicationlevel programmers need to think about when porting their applicationto run under Wayland. In particular input is a field where X haslagged behind current technology - Tiago will show how the exemplaryinput architecture in Wayland can be exploited to create compellingmodern user experiences.

SUMMARY:How to trick a developer into being a designer?
DESCRIPTION: We can't get anywhere with free software if the developers don't dodesign. They always did. It just sucked because they went with whateverthe first iteration was. The focal point changed and "we'll add some UIlater" is not design. Interaction with the software is key. Design requires you to have a general idea about the interactionupfront, but not everything. Once a general idea is out there an agreedupon, the second part of the design process kicks in."Prototyping"Prototypes help you see the flaws of a design more clearly, and missingfeatures can be added to accelerate the design/development of theproject. Frequent and agile iterations between visual designing &prototyping is part of a healthy design process.Since developers can write code they can also prototype, (as long asthey don't get attached to their code).This talk is about how designers tricked a developer to be one ofthem...
