SUMMARY:greenlight for girls
DESCRIPTION: Greenlightforgirls.org is a Brussels-based, international NGO promoting science, technology, engineering and mathematics to girls of all ages and backgrounds. We promote female role models from technical sectors to youngsters, and run events which inspire girls to study and pursue careers in technical areas, including computers. With this knowledge, we believe girls will save the world!As EU Director and global Technology Chair of the greenlight for girls foundation I aim to:  1. Create awareness about the need to attract more youth - especially girls - to computer science-related studies and careers, and science/tech sectors, in general;  2. Showcase the global activities of our foundation (20 events around the world in just our first 1.5 years in existence); and 3. Seek support from the global FLOSS (women?) developer community for g4g initiatives specifically requiring their involvement to succeed.

SUMMARY:Dovecot: More than an email server
DESCRIPTION: Dovecot is primarily an IMAP server, but nowadays it could also be used as a core for many other things: Rapid development of a feature rich email client, easily trying out your own IMAP protocol replacement, creating an IMAP proxy with mail filtering capabilities, and so on. Most of this is possible due to a new "imapc" mail storage backend, which makes Dovecot act as an IMAP client.

SUMMARY:Audiveris: Optical Music Recognition
DESCRIPTION: What can you do with your collection of sheet music, when all you have is paper or plain scans?You surely may feel frustrated if you are not ready for tedious sessions of manual typing.Here, *O*ptical *M*usic *R*ecognition comes to the rescue. It transcribes sheet music images to MusicXML symbolic format. Doing so, music content gets really "usable", since it can now easily be played, printed, transposed, re-published, analyzed, searched, etc.

DESCRIPTION: So you have your system set up to work perfectly. But moving to new machines, adding or changing configs etc is hard and takes way too much time. Thus, you hacked up a common CVS/SVN/Git/whatever repository and soft-link into $HOME. There is a better way and it's called vcsh.

DESCRIPTION: Wouldn't it be great if our phones, tablets, laptops and other mobile gadgets could use the same IP (v4 and/or v6) address regardless of which network they are connected to? And all that without a fixed tunnel causing path stretch, while offering some advanced traffic management features? This talk will present the LISPmob project, which implements a network layer mobility solution based on the Locator/ID Separation Protocol.

DESCRIPTION: Dynamic taint analysis is a powerful technique to detect memory corruption attacks. Yet with typical overheads of an order of magnitude, it is not something you would choose to deploy in any production environment.  Minemu is a fast taint-tracking emulator for Linux which aims to be fast enough to be run on production systems.

SUMMARY:Wikiotics - Bridging the FOSS and Edu worlds through language instruction 
DESCRIPTION: The people who believe in free software and open education have a lot in common, but few shared projects. Wikiotics has run for three years as a one such hybrid project and in the process spent a lot of time talking about education at free software conferences and about free software at education ones. If you have ever wondered why there aren't more projects like Wikipedia out there, come hear about some of the difficulties and opportunities for Foss/Edu collaboration.

DESCRIPTION: This lightning talk will be an overview of the important features of PMD 5.0, from which a beta should be release before then.Introducing briefly what PMD does (static code control and analysis) and how it does it (using XPath to query over Abstract Syntax Tree provided by pre-compilation), the talk will focus on the more important enhancement of this version: multi language support, mostly achieved by the great work of Ryan Gustavson between 2009 - 2010. With this features, PMD can be easily extend to support a large set of languages, including already XML based languages and ECMAScript (more commonly designated by the name JavaScript)

SUMMARY:Wazaabi - Model your UI ... live
DESCRIPTION: UI development usually consists in building software components that rely on a business data model. But business data models need to change frequently to adapt user requirement updates. This implies to adapt frequently the UI components.Nowadays, existing solutions provide a way to support these changes by providing code generation and data binding. But, these solutions are still slow. Then, the development cost increases rapidly if you have frequently requirement updates and/or many UI components.Wazaabi aims to reduce this cost by providing a solution based on models which doesn't require code generation. Based on Eclipse EMF, Wazaabi provides an open source framework that implements a dynamic declarative UI mechanism. The Wazaabi framework is directly based on the business data model and will evolve with it.This presentation aims to give a look inside this framework.

SUMMARY:Unhosted
DESCRIPTION: Unhosted is a non-profit project defining a standard to separate web applications from data storage. The web apps are pure client-side Javascript, fully inspectable and thus enable truly free software on the web. It also allows app developers to enter the web market a lot faster by not needing to care for any data storage. At the same time, users have their data in one place and can use all the apps with just one account and data storage.
