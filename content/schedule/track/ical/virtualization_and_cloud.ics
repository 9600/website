SUMMARY:libguestfs - tools for modifying virtual machine disk images
DESCRIPTION: libguestfs is a set of tools for accessing and modifying virtual machine (VM) disk images.  You can use this to inject files, resize, rescue, create, view or audit disks.  libguestfs is also a library that you can link to management programs written in C, Perl, Python, Ruby, Java and other languages.  In this talk, Richard Jones willintroduce the tools and give live demonstrations.  He also talks about how they work behind the scenes.

SUMMARY:Open Cloud Interoperability with CompatibleOne
DESCRIPTION: This talk will detail the architecture the CompatibleOne open source collaborative project and will conclude with a live demonstration of what seems to be the first open source cloud broker. CompatibleOne develops interoperable middleware for the description and federation of heterogeneous clouds comprising resources provisioned by different vendors. The aim of CompatibleOne is break vendor-lock-in for developers and users by providing interoperability with most platforms. The project contributes to the cloud stack of the OW2 Open Source Cloudware initiative (OSCi).

SUMMARY:Open Clouds with Deltacloud API
DESCRIPTION: Start an instance on an internal cloud, then with the same code start another on EC2 or Rackspace. Deltacloud protects your apps from cloud API changes and incompatibilities, so you can concentrate on managing cloud instances the way you want. Deltacloud API prosper from natural open-source evolution and use community drivenAPI design instead of vendor enforced one.

SUMMARY:DMTF CIMI and Apache Deltacloud
DESCRIPTION: The DMTF CIMI specification describes the model and protocol for management interactions between a cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provider and the consumers of an IaaS service. The basic entities of IaaS (machines, storage, and networks) are modeled with the goal of providing consumer management access to an implementation of IaaS and facilitating portability between cloud implementations that support the specification. This talk will introduce the current work-in-progress CIMI specification and the initial implementation of that spec. as part of the Apache Deltacloud project.

SUMMARY:Infrastructure as an open-source project
DESCRIPTION: I've been moving the site operations model of the Wikimedia infrastructure from being a closed, mainly staff-only, model to an open to all model of contributions. I'm treating operations like an open source project, using Puppet, OpenStack and Git. The bottleneck of the operations team is greatly lessened, allowing volunteer contributions to be accepted and implemented much faster.In this presentation, I'll describe the architecture of the Wikimedia Labs project, and how we are utilizing it to allow anyone to push changes from ideas to production. I'll also describe how this same model can apply to other open source projects, and also how it could apply more generally in private cloud implementations.

SUMMARY:Deploying OpenStack with the XCP toolstack on Ubuntu
DESCRIPTION: The Xen Cloud Platform (XCP) is an open source virtualization platform based on the Xen hypervisor. XCP isn't a server application which you install alongside of Xen, but rather an "embedded" appliance, which manages your host. While this gives XCP developers the ability to provide a tightly controlled, well integrated system, it makes it more difficult for FOSS developers to use and modify our software. To correct this, we have recently ported the XCP toolstack to run on Debian; it is currently in Debian unstable and will be in the next release of Ubuntu.In this presentation, we would like to demonstrate the XCP toolstack running on Ubuntu. We will show how easy it is to use the toolstack to create and manage virtual machines, and how you can use XCP and XenServer management tools with the XCP toolstack on Ubuntu. We will also demo our software running OpenStack.

SUMMARY:OpenStack developers meeting & Distribution panel
DESCRIPTION: The OpenStack developers ecosystem consists of OpenStack core developers, but also upstream project developers and downstream distribution packagers, producers of compatible tools... In this town hall meeting, we will all gather for an informal workshop where we'll openly discuss issues and how we can solve them as a community. In particular, we'll have a panel discussion with packagers from various distributions, but we also expect themes like project policies, QA or governance to be addressed. Come and join us !

SUMMARY:USB redirection over the network
DESCRIPTION: USB redirection is using USB devices attached to a real machine inside a virtual machine (guest).The focus of the talk will be the special case where the USB device being redirected is not attachedto the physical machine hosting the virtual machine, but to some other machine. The talk will presentand discuss the ongoing work to create an FOSS solution for this, getting this merged into upstreamqemu, as well is integrating this into Spice and the Spice-client.The intended audience are people who are interested in usb in virtual machines (vusb) bothdevelopers and users. The audience is expected to be familiar with generic virtualization concepts,but no deep technical knowledge is required.

SUMMARY:Ultralightweight Kernel Service Virtualization with Rump Kernels
DESCRIPTION: Existing virtualization solutions such as Xen, QEMU and usermode operating systems virtualize the entire OS.  While this is useful in a machine room type of use case, it is unnecessarily heavyweight when the interest is in virtualizing only one kernel driver or one kernel service.This talk introduces the anykernel architecture and rump kernels, which allow to safely virtualize individual drivers and subsystems from a monolithic kernel. Rump kernels can be used in a variety of different configurations, such as an application library, a microkernel style server, or as a server over the Internet.We will go over a number of real world use cases and present results which show that in their application domain rump kernels are faster, smaller and more agile than full OS virtualization technologies.

SUMMARY:Tracing and virtualization workshop, millikernels and anykernels
DESCRIPTION: There are tons of virtualization projects based on tracing: user-mode linux, umview/kmview, fakeroot-ng, cde.Ptrace is ugly and old but fundamentals tools rely on it: gdb, strace. New tracing facilities like uprobes, lttng and systemtap have been designed mainly (only) for debugging, not for virtualization. In the meanwhile there are new efforts to create more flexible kernels: anykernels and millikernels. These new approaches need a specific support: hooks, hypercall or tracing. It does not matter how we call it. Utrace is (was) an option, with some minor effort at kernel level, even classic ptrace could be implemented at user level for back compatibility.The workshop wants to be a technologically agnostic discussion on tracing supports for virtualization and for new flexible kernels.All contributors of new ideas are welcome to the open discussion.

SUMMARY:Building app sandboxes on top of LXC and KVM with libvirt
DESCRIPTION: The libvirt library provides a hypervisor agnostic API for interacting with & managing virtualization hosts. Traditional uses of virtualization have focused on running entire operating systems in virtual machines or containers. The libvirt-sandbox library builds on libvirt, LXC & KVM, providing an API which facilitates the use of virtualization as a tool for building secure application sandboxes, without the additional burden of maintaining additional OS installations.

SUMMARY:Deploying Xen: troubleshooting surgery & discussion with Xen.org developers
DESCRIPTION: Recent developments in the Xen community mean that installing and configuring a Xen host has never been easier. However Xen remains both powerful and complex which can prevent a barrier to those wishing to deploy Xen.In this panel discussion we will briefly present recent user facing changes to the way in which Xen is deployed (e.g. xend to xl toolstack migration, Project Kronos, pvops Linux kernel domain 0 support).The bulk of the session will be an opportunity for users to describe problems which they are having deploying Xen and discuss the solution and possible future directions with a panel of Xen developers.
