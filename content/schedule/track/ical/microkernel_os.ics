SUMMARY:Welcome! or Why do we meet here today
DESCRIPTION: This short talk is intended as the opening talk of the entire devroom.After a welcome greeting, I will briefly ponder about the motivation formeeting together and attempt a basic quantitative comparison ofparticipating projects based on available project-metric data. The goalof this quick comparison is to illustrate some apparent similarities anddifferences between our projects, and to further support our common cause.

SUMMARY:Introduction to the NOVA kernel API
DESCRIPTION: The NOVA virtualization architecture is comprised of amicrohypervisor and a capability-based multiserver userland with aspecific focus on enabling secure and efficient virtualization using x86hardware virtualization extensions (VT-x, VT-d, SR-IOV). It does so bymoving almost all of the actual "virtualization" into a per-VM userspacecomponent that is not in the Trusted Computing Base of other virtualmachines. This talk will give an overview of NOVA's unique executionmodel and API with a strong focus on how this enables efficientexecution of a VMM. Specifically, this talk will cover how tasks andthreads are realized in NOVA, how communication between threads works,how VM exits are handled in NOVA and how this extends to SMP machines.

SUMMARY:Introduction of the Genode OS Framework
DESCRIPTION: Today's operating systems try to find a balance between seeminglyconflicting goals. Ease of use is traded against security, resourceutilization is traded against resource accountability, and systemcomplexity is traded against scalability. For example, SELinux is illfamed as hard to use and consequently remains widely unused. As anotherexample, isolation kernels minimize the complexity of critical systemsoftware but at the cost of limiting these solutions to static applications.The Genode OS architecture shows how these apparently inherent conflictscan be solved by operating-system design.

SUMMARY:Introduction to HelenOS
DESCRIPTION: HelenOS is a general-purpose multiserver operating system written from scratch. It is based on a custom microkernel, SPARTAN, which currently runs on seven different CPU architectures (ARM, IA-32, x86-64, Itanium, MIPS, PowerPC and SPARC V9) . Most system services (e.g. device drivers, file systems, networking) are implemented in regular user-space processes which communicate via asynchronous messaging.First, the talk will briefly introduce the HelenOS project history and community structure. Second, we will briefly talk about the major technical areas and specifics of the system (boot and kernel, IPC mechanisms and naming services, devices and filesystems). This part will be supported by demos of the running system as well as by showing the structure of the source code. Last, we will look at what functionality is already there, what is currently being actively worked on and what are the future plans, which aim toward making the system self-hosting.

SUMMARY:The microkernel overhead
DESCRIPTION: Since the famous [Tanenbaum-Torvalds debate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanenbaum–Torvalds_debate) the general public sticks to the golden rule of thumb: Microkernel systems, while nice and elegant, are just academic toys. Due to the infamous communication overhead and other self-imposed limitations, they are never going to be as useful for the general use (in terms of performance) as the good old monolithic systems.Since the 1990s many researchers (especially the people around L4) have struggled to lower the overhead using the most extraordinary tricks. Others have tried to apply the microkernel design to mission critical, safety critical and other niche targets, where the benefits of the microkernel design clearly outweights the drawbacks. And other folks spent years creating hybrid systems to get the best (and hopefully not the worst) of the both worlds.But are the drawbacks of the microkernels fundamental?

SUMMARY:The agony of choice - the diversity of microkernels in Genode
DESCRIPTION: One shiny aspect of the Genode OS framework is its diversity withrespect to microkernels and hardware platforms it's running on top of.Although primarily of interest to clients and users, this propertyprovides some hidden benefits to the system-developer itself.This talk is basically an experience report. It will give you an insightinto the benefits and troubles of developing on a diverse biotope, thestrength and weaknesses of the available platforms, how Genode getsported to a kernel, and what is basically necessary from the kernel'sperspective to drive Genode. The last point will be illustrated byintroducing recent developments of a hybrid kernel/user API in Genode.

SUMMARY:Dive into HelenOS Device Drivers
DESCRIPTION: Implementing support for device drivers (device driver frameworks) in a microkernel-based/multiserver operating system presents some unique challenges. In this talk we will go through all the important aspects of device drivers in HelenOS, at the hurdles and the ways they can be overcome. We will discuss topics such as:  - Programmed I/O and DMA in user space  - Level interrupt handling and interrupt clearing, tasklets  - Cooperation of user-space drivers and kernel (debugging) drivers  - DDF and Device Manager - automatic driver start, device enumeration and hot (un)plug  - Exposing driver services, Location Service - drivers are not created more equal than others, a.k.a Death of the Pseudo Device
