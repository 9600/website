SUMMARY:Voice Applications for the Modern Open Source Hacker
DESCRIPTION: Many open source hackers see the allure of building applications that integrate with the telephone network.  However layers of industry jargon, proprietary technology and arcane knowledge lead many to believe that telephony is "hard."  Adhearsion will change their minds.  The Adhearsion project is an open source voice application development framework, the first of its kind in the open source world.  In this talk we will build several working voice applications and demonstrate how to integrate them with external services.  Along the way, we will discuss voice application design and show how to avoid common pitfalls.

SUMMARY:Internet of Threads
DESCRIPTION: "Internet of Threads" gives a new perspective on the Internet. Each process, group of processes or even a single thread can be an Internet node, having its own ip address, QoS, routing etc. Virtual Distributed Ethernet, User mode IP stacks, partial virtual machines can make this change possible.

SUMMARY:A strategy for managing diverse equipment in the CERN controls group
DESCRIPTION: The CERN accelerator control systems access equipment distributed over ageographic area tens of kilometers across.  When off the shelf hardware is not available engineers design and prototype I/Odevices as needed. With the advent of the open hardware repository, collaborations between the physics laboratories, research institutes and industry now ensure high quality designs and generality. The manufacture ofthese devices may be tendered out to industry and the companies involved arefree to add them to their own catalogs.   The control system requires very precise timing and synchronization of controland acquisition values over a large area and a diverse array of configurableequipment connected to the accelerators. Great care is required to manage thecontrol system timing and configuration so that remote FPGA cores are set up correctly.The “White-Rabbit” timing project is open and addresses the future timingand synchronization needs for CERN and other laboratories. White-rabbit makesuse of synchronous Ethernet and uses ideas from IEEE 1588 PTP protocol to synchronize remote equipment up to 10Km apart to better than one nanosecond.   Various control system devices at different geographic locations will have onboard FPGA logic loaded dynamically by carrier FMC device drivers with configuration data. Device specific drivers then scan the FPGA configurationvia a Wishbone-standard bus to determine the installation and if any further configuration is needed.   Etherbone is a software extension of the Wishbone hardware standard permittingremote FPGA cores to communicate with each other and with other control systemcomponents.The variety of I/O peripherals, their wide range of activation modeand the requirement to move several megabytes of data per channel persecond is managed by ZIO, a new I/O framework designed to handlethe usual I/O channels but also pulse generation and sampling; allperipherals may also be white-rabbit-aware, so that their owntimestamps are more precise than what the host computer can offer.Although ZIO examples drive simple I/O channels, the system is ableto DMA directly to user space, to sustain high data rates.
