SUMMARY:Ensuring uptime in a small startup
DESCRIPTION: Running a web application that is used by people from all over the world means that you cannot afford any downtime.However, the codebase and the database schema constantly evolves, while at the same time hardware failures may happen.The talk will try to present ways that we, at transifex.net, use to deal with the following two issues:- schema changes- hardware failuresin order to achieve 100% uptime.The talk will discuss tools that PostgreSQL provides, like functions and triggers, and how they can be used to deal with schema changes and how to setup streaming replication for fail-over.

SUMMARY:Create a Foreign Data Wrapper in 15 minutes
DESCRIPTION: SQL/MED is the new frontier of PostgreSQL ! Since the release of PostgreSQL 9.1, we see lots of Foreign Data Wrappers (FDW) coming out, giving you the ability to connect your database with multiple data sources : local files, other RDMS, NoSQL stores, webservices, etc.The primary language to write a FDW is C. But a recent extension called "Multicorn" makes Foreign Data Wrapper development easy, by allowing the programmer to use the Python programming language.This talks will :  * Explain the basics of SQL/MED  * Give an overview of the various existing Foreign Data Wrappers  * Show how to code a wrapper in a blink of en eye with multicorn

SUMMARY:PostgreSQL Clustering with Red Hat Cluster Suite
DESCRIPTION: Red Hat Cluster Suite is a robust technology that is used at many areas.PostgreSQL can be directly used with Red Hat Cluster Suite, in order to create an active-passive clustering environment.                                                                                                                                                                                 In this session, we will setup a two-node cluster, learn how to configure it, also talk about some more details.

SUMMARY:Hooks in PostgreSQL
DESCRIPTION: PostgreSQL's extensibility is well known. Most people have heard of user types, user operators, the new extension capability, and such. But few know about hooks in PostgreSQL. This talk will cover all kinds of hooks available in PostgreSQL, and will show some tools using them already.

SUMMARY:PostgreSQL on NFS
DESCRIPTION: When asked by a client to help them setting up a PostgreSQL cluster with NFS-based storage, my first gut reaction was: don't. But as it turns out, this is not such an unholy combination; as long as you keep in mind the effects different settings have on both the NFS client and NFS server and the expections PostgreSQL has regarding file operations, one can get away with it.

SUMMARY:Database Virtualization
DESCRIPTION: Virtualization presents a unique set both of challenges and opportunities. You'll find out what a good many of these are, and how to take advantage of the latter while avoiding the former as much as possible.
