SUMMARY:intel userspace
DESCRIPTION: Updates from the Intel userland: GL, X, and infrastructure.Much has changed for the better in Linux graphics in the last few years. The radical changes driver architecture to make compositing possible arestabilized and mainstream, new desktop environments are popping up regularly making use of these features, and OpenGL is changing from a usually buggy luxury component to a standard working part of Linux.In this talk, Eric will cover what has been going on in the Intel graphics driver stack to stabilize Linux graphics and catch up to thecapabilities of of the hardware.

SUMMARY:Input in a modern world - input methods and multitouch. 
DESCRIPTION: This talk will cover two topics, input methods and multitouch support. Input methods are a particularly ill-understood, but hugely important, part of the X input system.  Any input more complex than 'this key produces this symbol', such as Compose keys or phonetic input for Asian languages, is handled by client-side support code.  This talk will give an overview of input methods in X, going through the standard protocol as well as some popular implementations, along with some ideas for future work.Multitouch support is a hugely attractive buzzword for many devices and form factors. Multitouch support claims to allow for intuitive interactions but so far has largely been limited to custom implementations. With the upcoming X Server 1.12 release, we now have generic multitouch support alongside traditional pointer/keyboard input. This talk will explain the fundamental principles, new event types and how the server behaves when multitouch input devices are present.

SUMMARY:Cairo: How to render tomorrow's user interfaces.
DESCRIPTION: Cairo is the drawing API that is used predominantly by the GTK stack along with Firefox and couple of ports of WebKit. It is designed as a comprehensible page layout API rather than as a high performance interface to the GPU. It is Cairo's job to bridge the gap between an easy-to-use drawing model and efficient rendering. This is not always as easy as it sounds...The talk will present the origins of Cairo, its successes, some of its failures, and the promising technologies for the future.

SUMMARY:Nouveau: Recap, on-going and future work
DESCRIPTION: This talk is about the Linux open-source driver for nVidia GPUs (desktop and laptop). It will start by a recap of the history of this open source driver.The talk will then continues by detailing the current (and future) state of the following components:- DRM + ddx: Modesetting & 2D- Mesa: 3D- Power ManagementSome demonstrations will also be performed such as video decoding and power management.Finally, this talk will also allow you to interact with many Nouveau developers and ask your questions directly.

SUMMARY:Liberating ARM's Mali GPU.
DESCRIPTION: While everything is pretty much said and done on the x86 graphics front, and all the players have taken their respective positions and stick by it (despite ones best efforts), nothing has been done for the ARM world, even with the massive market penetration the linux and ARM combination currently has.The Mali is ARM's own GPU that is rapidly gaining traction. The most popular high end android smartphone so far is Samsung's Galaxy S2. The Mali-400 present in the Exynos SoC of the Galaxy S2 has been leader of the benchmarks for quite a bit. Besides the exynos, Mali is present in a rapidly growing number of SoCs, including telechips, allwinner, amlogic, realtek, VIA, ... The OpenGLES2.0 capable (and thus with separate vertex and fragment shaders) Mali is a highly clean design, and, of all the possible ARM GPUs, the perfect candidate for a free software driver.This talk will explain the rationale behind this project, the methodology used, the current status and the future direction. At the end, the current functionality (which is rapidly growing) will be demoed on both Mali-200 and Mali-400 based hardware. It will kick off a new era for free software graphics driver development.

SUMMARY:X Server 1.12 and beyond.
DESCRIPTION: Version 1.12 of the X server is scheduled to be released in early March, shortly after FOSDEM occurs. The talk will cover what has changed since 1.11, including multi-touch support, and a raft of code cleanups to try and bring the server out of the last century.  Beyond 1.12, this presentation will outline further work planned for the Linux desktop. How X and Wayland will work together, the work remaining to support OpenGL 3.0 and beyond within the X environment and further plans to streamline and modernize the code base.

SUMMARY:Colour Management in Compositors.
DESCRIPTION: Xorg allows compositors to run on efficient GPU hardware. It is possibly to deploy GPUs for low power consumption colour correction of the whole desktop. The talk will introduce in the topic by the CompICC colour server implementation and give a overview about used techniques and concepts. It will try to outline next generation desktop colour management and what is needed to get colour management well supported in graphics servers and deployed by toolkits and applications.
