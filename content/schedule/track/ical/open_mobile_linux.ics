SUMMARY:Mer ... and what you can do with it
DESCRIPTION: Mer says it is "aimed at device manufacturers" - but what does this mean? It has the same source as many other distros so this talk will introduce the non-code areas where Mer differentiates and how it does that by operating in the open. From systems and tools to processes; what's available, what Mer does and does not address and how a Mer-based project gets going?

SUMMARY:Towards Accelerated UI's on Mobile Linux With Power of Qt5
DESCRIPTION: Qt has had a support for embedding accelerated native OpenGL code inside Qt applications, but hardware graphics acceleration has been always a bottleneck on Linux platforms due to lack of proper support and driver openness. The situation is getting better every day, and with hard effort there are now several hardware acceleration capable Linux devices either in the market already, or coming in a few months. Combined with capabilities of Qt version 5, including QML SceneGraph and OpenGL Shaders in QML called ShaderEffects, the possibilities are endless. 2D or 3D UI's with 60fps on a mobile Linux device is not only a dream these days.

SUMMARY:Intro to Tizen and the Future of the Community
DESCRIPTION: This session will provide a basic intro to Tizen and will talkabout the community transition from MeeGo to Tizen. We'll do a quick recapfrom past year of the MeeGo community along with some things we learnedalong the way. The rest of the presentation will talk about what we aredoing to form the Tizen community and how you can participate.I'll also gather feedback during the Q&A on what you would like to see usdo differently in the Tizen community.

SUMMARY:buildroot: flexible building of a custom embedded system
DESCRIPTION: Buildroot is a nice, simple and efficient tool to build small to medium sized embedded Linux systems. It to automates the process of building a cross-compiling toolchain, the root filesystem with all userspace components, a Linux kernel image and a bootloader image.  It is used for embedded systems ranging from industrial controllers to hand-held media devices.

SUMMARY:Deep Dive into KDE Mobile development on N9/N950 (Harmattan)
DESCRIPTION: The Nokia N9 phone has recently been released to the public, running the shinyMeeGo 1.2 Harmattan. External developers were able to get such devices viaseveral mediums. Qt is at the center of this platform. It provides a great setof tools and libraries that make this device very accessible and give anexcellent way to learn Qt development; also to experiment with KDE Mobileapplication development. In this presentation the KDE Mobile developmentworkflow will be presented. Practically almost everything you need to know abouthow to make or port a KDE application for those gadgets and how to make the mostout of the development tools.

SUMMARY:Community Qt apps repository - way forward
DESCRIPTION: At the moment it is hard to find out what kind of Qt apps have beendeveloped in the community, for various devices eg. Nokia N9, MeeGotablets or Mer/Nemo. This is a missed opportunity for everybody.However we have such a system already in place, that is Apps for MeeGo(apps.formeego.org). It has all of the basic pieces in place already,and has been developed with the same folks who brought as the Maemoextras. In this talk I present the current status of apps.formeego.org(with demo(s)), and ask the question: can we build one central "appstore" for community Qt applications? What is in place already, andwhat needs to be done?

SUMMARY:Maliit - the open mobile text input project
DESCRIPTION: Maliit is an open source project for enabling first-class text input solutions for mobile devices. The project aims to provides a reference solution for easy integration, and a framework that others can build upon. It also strives to work closely with the wider community to improve mobile text input on open platforms. Current examples include its use in MeeGo, Nemo Mobile and Maemo Fremantle, the integration in Qt Components and Libmeegotouch, and improvements made to Qt and GTK+ input method interfaces.

SUMMARY:Nemo Mobile - How to contribute to the project
DESCRIPTION: Nemo Mobile is a linux distribution that is based on Mer Core and is using MeeGo Handset UX as its UX at the moment. Probably the easiest way is to think that the Nemo Mobile continues where MeeGo Community Edition (MeeGo CE) left off, with the main difference that it uses Mer as the core instead of MeeGo. In this talk the current status of the project is shown as well as the basics of how community can contribute to the project.

SUMMARY:An update on PIM storage and sync: SyncEvolution
DESCRIPTION: SyncEvolution has been the main synchronization engine in Moblin, MeeGo (together with Buteo) and will also be used inTizen. In addition there have been stable, regular upstream releases for desktop Linux since 2005. Ports to the N900 and N9are available, using their native PIM storage. This talk will give an overview of the architecture and introduce the latest features: KDE support, CalDAV/CardDAV synchronization, and ActiveSync.

SUMMARY:OS in the Mobile App Stores
DESCRIPTION: "Apple drops GPL apps" was a headline in the Linux User & Developer Magazine in 2011. Later Windows followed the example of Apple. So does this mean GPL licensed apps can't go mobile? Luckily, it's not that dramatic. This talk will share the first hand experience of the challenges and opportunities of releasing GPL based apps in the Apple app store.

SUMMARY:Rygel: Free and Open Mobile DLNA
DESCRIPTION: Getting to the point of having a working, low-resource DLNA-readyimplementation is a hard task. Fortunately there's an easy way out -Rygel. It is a modular and extensible solution to help you out of thatdilemma with minimum effort.Rygel started its life for GNOME Mobile and was the designated UPnP/DLNAstack for Maemo Freemantle and MeeGo/Harmattan. It is supposed to workout-of-the box with no setup required, operating nicely with all kindsof quirky devices.
