SUMMARY:Mozilla Communities - Agile approach, tools, patterns and metrics
DESCRIPTION: We're living in hard times right now. Most of the F(L)OSS projects suffers from lack of volunteers especially if they must donate a large amount of time to this project. My talk will show how you can plan better your community how to measure it, how to use tips and tricks from the commercial world and how to use some agile methods and tools to make you community kick-ass squad. * How to plan your community for next couple of months; (ex. We need 3 more people to join our translation effort) and Create the Flow – how a bug report goes from bugzilla to the the end of it’s life. (a.k.a kill the bug)* Define how to do it (ex. Troll the forums, create twitter campaign, contact universities, or something else?)* How to Measure it (How many retweets do you have, how many clicks, etc) and Why?* How to find patterns into your community and how to use them. For example – Most of the answers I receive to my mailing comes during business hours OR Friday is not a good day to send emails* What is Agile and how to use it to make my community life easier? ( Trello show-case )

SUMMARY:Developing Firefox in 2012 - Add-ons, Jetpack, Github and more
DESCRIPTION: The plans for Firefox in 2012 are huge. However, hacking on Firefox has a huge learning curve, and requires specialists with experiential knowledge of a sea of undocumented code and familiarity with a host of implicit behaviors that are impossible to predict. The risk of regression, even after years of requiring tests, is still quite high. New features continue to take far longer than we expect, and we continually rely on the same small group of people to develop them, and an even smaller group to review them. How can we make the development of Firefox easier for new contributors, as well as ourselves? I'll talk about new approaches towards feature development and contributor interaction that can reduce the time required and risk involved in Firefox development.

The aim of this project is to produce an apps eco-system on the Web that uses open technologies and gives developers and users the freedom to sell and use apps in the way they want.Aside from the conceptual issues that this project tackles, Rob will also cover some of the JavaScript APIs that are being worked on to provide the necessary functionality for apps. It is these APIs that allow developers to create an immersive experience within their apps that they wouldn't have been able to achieve in the browser until now.

SUMMARY:Boot to Gecko and Web API
DESCRIPTION: Boot2Gecko (B2G) is a complete OS built on the open web platform.  Every "app" from the lock screen to the phone dialer is a "web app", built with HTML/JS/CSS.  Where we encounter gaps in the open web platform as compared to other phone OSes, we plug the gaps with new Web APIs, to be standardized by web standards bodies.  If you know how to write a web page, you will be able to write phone apps.  B2G is developed according to Mozilla's values: in the open, with source code always available, and on open standards.  In this talk, we'll discuss the motivation for B2G and some of its implementation.  And of course, there will be a demo!

SUMMARY:Tracking Firefox performance via Telemetry
DESCRIPTION: Traditionally Mozilla measured Firefox performance with a set of performance tests called Talos. For features not covered by Talos developers benchmarked individual features themselves.However, it turns it is extremely difficult to design a representative testsuite. Reproducing performance problems is often harder than fixing them.Telemetry is a way to measure Firefox performance & usage in the field. It allows developers to insert lightweight probes and then use them to track how Firefox behaves in the wild. We have been using Telemetry to improve Firefox since version 7. We will soon roll out Telemetry to addon developers so they can benefit from the same infrastructure. This talk will cover how Telemetry is used and the kinds of problems it helped us fix so far.
