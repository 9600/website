SUMMARY:NanoBSD and the art of Timekeeping with appliances.
DESCRIPTION: The time has come to make the switch from embedded Linux to embedded BSD....In this talk we will focus on the building of embedded appliances in the BSD world,and more specifically on using NanoBSD to create FreeBSD images that run onembedded systems.In the stock FreeBSD distribution an application (script) called NanoBSD is presentthat takes a configuration file and builds an image for a flash disk which then can beused on an embedded system. A short cookbook will be presented on the stepsneeded to actually create the image, and deploy it. Also the in-system upgrading ofthe image will be discussed.The use case we will present is an Stratum 0 NTP appliance that serves as networktime server using GPS with PPS synchronization. This appliance is capable ofproviding highly accurate time service to a network of servers and desktopmachines, even when disconnected from the internet. The example will use a Soekris4501 embedded board and an OEM hockey puck-style GPS device and some tricks touse the high-res timing on the board, together with a temperature controlled crystaloscillator.The contents of talk have previously been published by the presenter in ;login:.the USENIX periodical [1]

SUMMARY:Mozilla Communities - Agile approach, tools, patterns and metrics
DESCRIPTION: We're living in hard times right now. Most of the F(L)OSS projects suffers from lack of volunteers especially if they must donate a large amount of time to this project. My talk will show how you can plan better your community how to measure it, how to use tips and tricks from the commercial world and how to use some agile methods and tools to make you community kick-ass squad. * How to plan your community for next couple of months; (ex. We need 3 more people to join our translation effort) and Create the Flow – how a bug report goes from bugzilla to the the end of it’s life. (a.k.a kill the bug)* Define how to do it (ex. Troll the forums, create twitter campaign, contact universities, or something else?)* How to Measure it (How many retweets do you have, how many clicks, etc) and Why?* How to find patterns into your community and how to use them. For example – Most of the answers I receive to my mailing comes during business hours OR Friday is not a good day to send emails* What is Agile and how to use it to make my community life easier? ( Trello show-case )

SUMMARY:Accessibility in LibreOffice
DESCRIPTION: LibreOffice has many features for accessible authoring: it provides functionality to use the accessibility features of the OpenDocument Format (ODF), it supports export to tagged PDF (unlike most other free and open-source tools), it has extensions for exporting to digital audio books (odt2daisy) and Braille (odt2braille), and an extension for evaluating and repairing accessibility issues in ODT, DOC and DOCX (AccessODF). It also implements accessibility APIs to enable users of assistive technologies to use the office suite. However, there is room for improvement, both with regard to the creation of accessible content and with regard to the accessibility of LibreOffice itself. This presentation will discuss both types of issues. It will highlight bugs and feature requests that could be addressed to make it easier to create accessible content, and issues related to the support for accessibility APIs.

SUMMARY:Ensuring uptime in a small startup
DESCRIPTION: Running a web application that is used by people from all over the world means that you cannot afford any downtime.However, the codebase and the database schema constantly evolves, while at the same time hardware failures may happen.The talk will try to present ways that we, at transifex.net, use to deal with the following two issues:- schema changes- hardware failuresin order to achieve 100% uptime.The talk will discuss tools that PostgreSQL provides, like functions and triggers, and how they can be used to deal with schema changes and how to setup streaming replication for fail-over.

SUMMARY:Coping with wide-impact changes in a distribution
DESCRIPTION: One part of the integration of upstream software in a distribution is to correctly deal with changes that have a wide impact, either because they affect a lot of other software, or because the changes will be highly visible to the users. And it is easy to feel that such changes are always going wrong: some applications stop working, many users complain about the change they feel was uncalled for, nearly nobody shares a thank you note.Such wide-impact changes always come with controversies, and being the bridge between users and upstreams, distributions are the place where all the rage is going on, with a social aspect that is usually at least as important as the technical side of things.The recent years have not been exempt of controversies, and we will share our experiences with user-visible changes such as the move to KDE 4, GNOME 3 and systemd.This talk will be co-presented by the SUSE Gang: Frédéric Crozat, Will Stephenson, Vincent Untz.

SUMMARY:Free Software: A viable model for Commercial Success
DESCRIPTION: This talk will discuss our experience at [AdaCore](http://www.adacore.com/), one of only a handful of 100% Free Software companies. All of our commercial products are licensed under the GPL and other Free Software Licenses.People often assume that there is a conflict between the use of such licenses and the needs of a commercial software company. Our experience at AdaCore shows that on the contrary, the Free Software model can be very successful both for us as a company and for our customers.We think this model can be used in many other circumstances, and want to encourage free software enthusiasts to consider this model in other circumstances.

SUMMARY:Open Licences before European Courts
DESCRIPTION: Open content licences are tools at the disposal of creative people who want to use their copyrights in a permissive manner. Their first aim is to allow the sharing and spreading of works, by granting rights to the users on a royalty-free basis. However, these licences remain binding legal documents, according to which licensees must respect some obligations, and which are enforceable before courts. The proposed presentation aims at providing an analysis of interesting court decisions where open content licences were at issue.Please review the links below for background information:

SUMMARY:GStreamer 1.0 - the next generation of your favourite multimedia framework
DESCRIPTION: GStreamer is a highly versatile plugin-based multimedia framework thatprovides abstractions to cater for a whole range of multimedia needs,whether desktop applications, streaming servers or multimediamiddleware; embedded systems, desktops or server farms.GStreamer 1.0 is the next generation of the successful GStreamer 0.10.xAPI series where some of the core API has got a complete overhaul toaddress many of the limitations we have run into over the years with theold API. In many respects, 1.0 will be pretty much the same as 0.10, butin others it will be radically different.This talk is a high-level overview of what's been happening in the worldof GStreamer as of late, with a special focus on the status of GStreamer1.0, highlighting some of the improvements it will bring.

SUMMARY:How to replace a legacy tool with 100k installations
DESCRIPTION: Debian has a number of legacy tools (that's a euphemism for ugly hacks) that are not addressed due to inertia, fear of breaking stuff, and the difficulty of reaching consensus for changes with cross-package impact. I'll talk about dealing with the above issues in the context of ongoing work as part of Debian Enhancement Proposal 9.Specifically, the talk will cover how (not) to make proposals for cross-package changes, and how to map behaviour in a technical spec to feature-centered assertions in a test suite.

SUMMARY:The Methods of FOSS Activism
DESCRIPTION: When changing laws threaten the FOSS community, it pushes back with activist campaigns lead by NGOs and non-profits.  These campaigns look much like the ones conducted by other groups of activists such as the human rights network.  When FOSS gets political, it typically uses a handful of common strategies.  This talk will build on information gathered from interviews and other research to describe what techniques free software advocates use when they try to influence government policy.  It will briefly evaluate their effect, taking examples from the ACTA campaign and from the reaction to proliferating three-strikes laws aimed at enforcing IP policy.  Then it will compare with other activist projects in other fields: FOSS advocates might expand their vocabulary of political action by borrowing the approaches used in other issue areas.

SUMMARY:Mer ... and what you can do with it
DESCRIPTION: Mer says it is "aimed at device manufacturers" - but what does this mean? It has the same source as many other distros so this talk will introduce the non-code areas where Mer differentiates and how it does that by operating in the open. From systems and tools to processes; what's available, what Mer does and does not address and how a Mer-based project gets going?

SUMMARY:Developing Firefox in 2012 - Add-ons, Jetpack, Github and more
DESCRIPTION: The plans for Firefox in 2012 are huge. However, hacking on Firefox has a huge learning curve, and requires specialists with experiential knowledge of a sea of undocumented code and familiarity with a host of implicit behaviors that are impossible to predict. The risk of regression, even after years of requiring tests, is still quite high. New features continue to take far longer than we expect, and we continually rely on the same small group of people to develop them, and an even smaller group to review them. How can we make the development of Firefox easier for new contributors, as well as ourselves? I'll talk about new approaches towards feature development and contributor interaction that can reduce the time required and risk involved in Firefox development.

SUMMARY:Input in a modern world - input methods and multitouch. 
DESCRIPTION: This talk will cover two topics, input methods and multitouch support. Input methods are a particularly ill-understood, but hugely important, part of the X input system.  Any input more complex than 'this key produces this symbol', such as Compose keys or phonetic input for Asian languages, is handled by client-side support code.  This talk will give an overview of input methods in X, going through the standard protocol as well as some popular implementations, along with some ideas for future work.Multitouch support is a hugely attractive buzzword for many devices and form factors. Multitouch support claims to allow for intuitive interactions but so far has largely been limited to custom implementations. With the upcoming X Server 1.12 release, we now have generic multitouch support alongside traditional pointer/keyboard input. This talk will explain the fundamental principles, new event types and how the server behaves when multitouch input devices are present.

Since the release of PostgreSQL 9.1, we see lots of Foreign Data Wrappers (FDW) coming out, giving you the ability to connect your database with multiple data sources : local files, other RDMS, NoSQL stores, webservices, etc.The primary language to write a FDW is C. But a recent extension called "Multicorn" makes Foreign Data Wrapper development easy, by allowing the programmer to use the Python programming language.This talks will :  * Explain the basics of SQL/MED  * Give an overview of the various existing Foreign Data Wrappers  * Show how to code a wrapper in a blink of en eye with multicorn

SUMMARY:Drools Planner: Planning optimization by example
DESCRIPTION: Better planning algorithms can help save the environment, reduce costs and improve service quality. All organisations have planning problems, such as employee rostering, task scheduling, vehicle routing or bin packing. Yet, they hardly optimize those problems. Why? Because those problems are “NP-complete”: computationally very difficult and humanly impossible to optimize. Drools Planner optimizes such planning problems for normal Java programmers.

SUMMARY:What Goes into an Executable? Identifying a Binary's Sources by Tracing Build Processes 
DESCRIPTION: Modern software is typically composed of numerous components, such as third-party open source packages. To prevent legal or security problems, software vendors must identify the components (including their licenses) used to create the binaries they ship. This requires knowing exactly which source code files and other artifacts are used to create a given binary, and how they are used (e.g.whether libraries are statically or dynamically linked). In this talk I will we show a generic method to reverse-engineer this information from the build processes of software products. The method traces system calls to determine the composition graph of sources and binaries involved in build processes.

SUMMARY:Towards Accelerated UI's on Mobile Linux With Power of Qt5
DESCRIPTION: Qt has had a support for embedding accelerated native OpenGL code inside Qt applications, but hardware graphics acceleration has been always a bottleneck on Linux platforms due to lack of proper support and driver openness. The situation is getting better every day, and with hard effort there are now several hardware acceleration capable Linux devices either in the market already, or coming in a few months. Combined with capabilities of Qt version 5, including QML SceneGraph and OpenGL Shaders in QML called ShaderEffects, the possibilities are endless. 2D or 3D UI's with 60fps on a mobile Linux device is not only a dream these days.

SUMMARY:Re-thinking system and distro development
DESCRIPTION: We believe system (and distribution) development needs to bere-thought from the basic concepts upwards. We've implemented someideas for streamlining development, reducing development friction,speeding up system upgrades and adding support for downgrades androllbacks, and generally making development of entire systems fasterand more fun.At the level of individual, atomic projects, several great tools anddevelopment methods have been developed over the past decade or so.Few of them are applied at the system or distribution level. The Linuxkernel development, for example, greatly benefits from the ease ofbranching and merging that git provides, but it is not possible to branchand merge the whole system, or distribution, consisting of hundredsor tens of thousands of individual projects.From the agile development worlds, automated testing, test drivendevelopment, and continuous integration are common-place for individualprojects, but not so much for complete systems development. Would it notbe nice to have them?Packages have been the darling child of Linux distribution developmentsince the early days. They are a natural, modular concept, and have beenone of the key factors behind the success of the distribution concept.Package managers have made it easy to install and remove and upgradeeach piece of software separately, and to upgrade the whole system byupgrading each installed package. However, a modern distribution consistsof tens of thousands of packages, and the combinatorial explosion ofdependencies and interaction may be getting out of hand. In this talkwe explore another way of approaching the packaging problem.We believe these and other changes are useful for bridging the currentgap between upstream development and end users, to speed up systemand distribution development, and to let system builders bravelyhack what no-one has hacked before.

SUMMARY:Cairo: How to render tomorrow's user interfaces.
DESCRIPTION: Cairo is the drawing API that is used predominantly by the GTK stack along with Firefox and couple of ports of WebKit. It is designed as a comprehensible page layout API rather than as a high performance interface to the GPU. It is Cairo's job to bridge the gap between an easy-to-use drawing model and efficient rendering. This is not always as easy as it sounds...The talk will present the origins of Cairo, its successes, some of its failures, and the promising technologies for the future.

SUMMARY:Openshift
DESCRIPTION: You're using IaaS to build a large scale, multi-tenant, hosted service. At the end of the day, you're hosting other people's code in some form.Your environment needs to be dynamic to properly utilize IaaS capabilities and meet user expectations. You need it to stay secure and controlled. Your users need to stay isolated from each other without feeling restricted. You need to control orchestration, workload management and security. You need to orchestrate to respond to changes in scale or failures at the IaaS level. You need workload management to control the resources a single user can consume and how contention is managed. Lastly, you need users to have access to as much as possible so they feel in control without risking your control of the overall system.This talk will show by example how Red Hat's OpenShift Platform-as-a-Service uses MCollective for orchestration, SELinux for segmentation, Linux Control Groups for workload management and some core operational fundamentals applied to cloud architectures to tackle this challenge.

SUMMARY:Multiarch - why it's important
DESCRIPTION: Multiarch is a properly generic solution to the installation and use of library packages from one than one architecture at a time, which changes the way running non-native binaries and crossbuilding are dealt with in a fundamental way. It is both powerful and intrusive and has taken a long time to make happen.This talk explains what it is, how it works, and what you can do with it. We will also discuss future adoption by other distros.

DESCRIPTION: The last few years has seen many different Mobile Linux projects come and go, both big and small, commercial and open source. This talk seeks to present about the current state of Mobile Linux and future challenges of the platforms that drive our mobile devices. The angle of attack is to identify and explain tendencies in technology about moving beyond Mobile Linux as defined by Linux handsets, netbooks and tablets - towards more unified and more connected experiences of interaction. The talk will center around the problems and challenges that open source efforts will have in such a world of connected experiences and describe what current efforts exist within the open source community that recognise this shift beyond traditional Mobile Linux.

SUMMARY:FLOSSing for Good Legal Hygiene: Stories from the Trenches
DESCRIPTION: The legal structures of free software projects go through phases ofpopularity reminiscent of fashion trends. The early days of freesoftware were decentralized and individualistic, partially inspired bythe "free culture" movements of the '60s. Over time, centralization andincorporated non-profit organizations grew popular, parallel with aperiod of time where FLOSS was struggling for recognition as a viablealternative to proprietary solutions. As FLOSS crested that wave, andwon the recognition of the business world, people began to recognize anover-proliferation of special-purpose foundations, and the conservancies(foundations that host multiple independent projects) came to the fore.In the past year we've seen a movement back toward decentralizedindividualism, questioning the need of any formal legal structures. Thefact of the matter is that free software and international law work justfine for a whole gamut of legal structures, from the lone individualhacker to the largest of incorporated entities. It's a free choice foreach project. The important thing is for every project to think throughtheir legal strategy. Not just the "What?" (-license? -contributionpolicy? -legal documentation?) but "Why?" (-pick option X over option Y?-are we doing this? -do we care?) and "How?" (-can we make this work forus? -will this affect our users and developers?).

SUMMARY:Using the OpenJDK to investigate covariance in Java
DESCRIPTION: The Java type system is unsafe since it allows covariant use of arrays. For example, an array of Bananas can be used where an array of Fruit is expected, given that Banana is a subclass of Fruit. This allows the following unsafe code:    Banana[] bananas = new Banana[5];    Fruit[] fruits = bananas;    fruits[0] = new Apple();  // runtime exception    bananas[0];  //  Apple?In the above example, the programmer gets back an Apple where he was expecting Bananas, causing an undesired runtime exception.We investigate the covariant use of arrays in open source Java programs to see whether programmers use this problematic feature of Java. We make use of the freely available OpenJDK, modifying its Java compiler to disallow covariant use of arrays, thus reporting any such uses as compile errors. We apply this compiler to a code corpus of 106 open source programs, including large and well-known programs such as Eclipse, JUnit and Ant. Initial results of our investigation show that covariance is rarely used outside the context of legacy code and Java libraries. This leads us to question its relevance in the Java language.In our talk, we also discuss solutions to covariance taken by other languages such as Scala and Google Dart, explain our modifications to the OpenJDK Java compiler and report the full results of our study.

SUMMARY:License issues in Android
DESCRIPTION: Android is rapidly becoming the primary vector through which open source software is entering into people's life, with new devices being announced almost daily. Unfortunately companies are cutting many corners, especially when it comes to licenses and quality assurance, because everyone is rushing their devices to market. The consequence is that many Android devices out there are not compliant with the licenses, with significant legal risk as a result, even though it is completely avoidable with a small investment in time and knowledge up front, saving a lot of time and money down the line. In this talk I want to highlight a few common violations, shatter a few myths about Android and provide some hints on how to improve the situation. This talk will not be about software patents

DESCRIPTION: Gluon is an open source database schema analysis and entity/relationship mapper that easily integrates into MonoDevelop. Using the MonoDevelop addin you can browse databases, select tables, generate entities (including bulk rename operations) and add the generated C# code to your project with a couple of clicks. If my cats will help with the coding it will probably support schema migration (from inside MonoDevelop) well before the FOSDEM. If they don't help there will be enough to talk anyway (and nice catfur dolls for everybody).

SUMMARY:JBoss AS7 : Building JBoss AS 7 for Fedora
DESCRIPTION: While JBoss AS 7 (Application Server) in itself is FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) I would also like to make sure that the building process itself does not rely on anything but FOSS. Having a FOSS build process will truly liberate *any* Java project. With an overview of JBoss AS  7 the stage will be set for what components need to be FOSSilized.Fedora, because it is the most passionate advocate of the FOSS build requirement, makes an excellent target OS for the initial prototype. Plus we can draw upon existing manpower and resources (from Fedora and EAP) to execute it.Some issues encountered:  Hibernate Core 4 needs Gradle to build  RESTEasy depends on JAXB Reference Implementation  JBoss VFS uses Microsoft code (during testing)Relying on build tools like Maven, Gradle or Ivy can inadvertently lead to issues where (semi-) unknown dependencies creep into the build process (or worse the runtime operation).If people give *no* thought to building their code FOSS style, making it fully FOSS becomes quite a choir (or even impossible). So if you care about FOSS, make sure your build is also FOSS.Let's start here, let's start with JBoss AS 7.

DESCRIPTION: Dovecot is primarily an IMAP server, but nowadays it could also be used as a core for many other things: Rapid development of a feature rich email client, easily trying out your own IMAP protocol replacement, creating an IMAP proxy with mail filtering capabilities, and so on. Most of this is possible due to a new "imapc" mail storage backend, which makes Dovecot act as an IMAP client.

SUMMARY:Community Qt apps repository - way forward
DESCRIPTION: At the moment it is hard to find out what kind of Qt apps have beendeveloped in the community, for various devices eg. Nokia N9, MeeGotablets or Mer/Nemo. This is a missed opportunity for everybody.However we have such a system already in place, that is Apps for MeeGo(apps.formeego.org). It has all of the basic pieces in place already,and has been developed with the same folks who brought as the Maemoextras. In this talk I present the current status of apps.formeego.org(with demo(s)), and ask the question: can we build one central "appstore" for community Qt applications? What is in place already, andwhat needs to be done?

We haven't even started!It's been a whirlwind trip so far with a great deal learned aboutpolitics, acronyms, the due diligence required on a JSR, flights toexotic places (Jersey City!?), wrangling over the wording of asentence and of course launching some developer lead initiatives.There have of course been some great successes in moving Free Javaforward such as the JSR-348 which is the start of reforming the JCPand JSRs towards a truly open and transparent model.  This talk coversthe good works done so far, some anecdotes of what it's like to workas a developer amongst a mix of technologists and bearucrats and whatwe think is left to be done.

We’llalso show you how can be part of that future, by contributing a patch,filling bugs or writing an extension.When you develop a major multi-platform desktop application that isused by millions of people, you sometimes have to do some crazy stuff.So we’ll share with you some of those things. Some of them will makeyou laugh, some of them will make you cry, but all of them qualify forat least one of the following adjectives : crazy, ridiculous, insane,unreasonable, awesome.

SUMMARY:JBoss Forge / Arquillian: Two Missing Links in Enterprise Java Development
DESCRIPTION: One common complaint you hear a lot about enterprise Java development is that it is quite a burden to get started. For a newbie, it takes a lot of knowledge and effort to even put the simplest JSF application to work. A second element that bothers a lot of people is that it is very difficult to verify that your enterprise components actually do what they are supposed to do. Even for seasoned enterprise developers integration testing can be a huge challenge.Luckily two recent additions to the JBoss toolset come to the rescue. Arquillian is a container-oriented testing framework built on TestNG and JUnit. It takes down the barrier of bootstrapping the necessary infrastructure when trying to perform integration tests. It lets you test your components in their real target runtime environment using real enterprise services. Secondly, JBoss Forge is an incremental enhancement tool that lets you take an existing Java project and safely add in new functionality. Whether you want to set up JSF, use persistence or enable integration testing with Arquillian, it all becomes a real breeze.Attend this session to learn how to take advantage of both these tools. You will see how they can be used to rapidly create, test and deploy enterprise Java applications. I will also show how they can be extended to put them even to greater use. They truly will turn out to be the missing links you have been looking for in enterprise Java Development.

SUMMARY:Virtualization with KVM: bottom to top, past to future
DESCRIPTION: The KVM hypervisor entered the Linux kernel at the beginning of 2007 and, since then, it has progressed a lot in terms of scalability, performance and features.  Together with it, an entirely open-source stack of user-mode virtualization tools has come into existence and seen vigorous development.  Its components include management tools (libvirt, oVirt), guest rescue and inspection tools (guestfish), desktop virtualization (spice), user interfaces (virt-manager and now Boxes).  The stability of the hypervisor and the fast-paced development of the tools created a virtuous circle that is quickly bridging the gap between proprietary and open-source virtualization.In this talk, I will highlight the recent additions to KVM and the accompanying tools, and present features that are new or in the works.

SUMMARY:True open hardware: Opencores and OpenRISC
DESCRIPTION: This presentation will be delivered in two sections, first anintroduction to the OpenRISC project by Julius Baxter, followed by alook at embedded hardware development with Open Source IP cores usingthe OpenRISC platform and the IP available on OpenCores.org with OlofKindgren.The OpenRISC Project:This project is aimed at developing embedded RISC microprocessorarchitectures and open source RTL implementations. Since its beginningin 1999, the project has attracted anyone interested in CPUdevelopment and covers everything from ISA definition to RTLdescription writing and testing to simulator, tool chain and operatingsystem porting. The presentation will cover the motivation, recentprogress and future plans of the project.Open Source Embedded Hardware Development:Most Open Source embedded developers end their quest for a fully OpenSource system when they get the data sheets. For the FPGA/ASICdevelopers at OpenCores, this is where the fun part begins. Instead ofrelying on the kindness of the chip manufacturers to deliver thedesired SoC functionality, Open Source hardware developers simplydesign their own with the standard peripherals and custom hardwareacceleration that of choice. This requires Open Source IP cores and aframework to put it all together.This presentation will contain an introduction to some of the benefitsof open source hardware and an overview of OpenCores. The main focuswill be on how to use the OpenRISC Reference Platform System on Chip(ORPSoC) to build a custom SoC, which will be demonstrated on theOpenRISC FPGA development board.

SUMMARY:Can for-profit companies enforce copyleft without becoming corrupt like MySQL AB?
DESCRIPTION: When a company authors free software under the GNU GPL, it is likely that it will discover license violations. Non profit like FSF or Software Freedom Conservancy will try to resolve such violations amicably, because their mission is to further Free Software. They will only go to court as a last resort, if the infringer refuses to comply with the licenses and keeps distributing the software. The primary goal of a company is to generate profit, it will therefore take advantage of violations to this end. For instance, part of the former MySQL AB company business model was to threaten infringers and require that they buy a proprietary license to be redeemed. However, most of the infringements are honest mistakes and such methods are not in the best interest of the Free Software community. They are even counter productive for the company who makes short term profits but eventually scare their customers away.

SUMMARY:Java in the Age of the JVM
DESCRIPTION: By now, it's become well understood that Java is far from dead, and that rumors of its demise have been greatly exaggerated. The language once written off maintains its truly unique role as the power behind the legacy enterprise applications as well as the foundation for some of the biggest and most influential next generation companies on the web. What is less clear, however, is the future of Java the language versus Java the platform.  JVM based languages are proliferating wildly: Scala, Clojure and its brethren are household names, and even established specialized languages like R are being ported to the JVM. What does this mean for the future of Java? Will they carry it forward into the future, or relegate it to the role of lower level component? We'll explore this question through a mix of quantitative data derived from sources like GitHub, HackerNews and StackOverflow, as well as qualitative research on technology developments and directions.

Probably the easiest way is to think that the Nemo Mobile continues where MeeGo Community Edition (MeeGo CE) left off, with the main difference that it uses Mer as the core instead of MeeGo. In this talk the current status of the project is shown as well as the basics of how community can contribute to the project.

SUMMARY:DMTF CIMI and Apache Deltacloud
DESCRIPTION: The DMTF CIMI specification describes the model and protocol for management interactions between a cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provider and the consumers of an IaaS service. The basic entities of IaaS (machines, storage, and networks) are modeled with the goal of providing consumer management access to an implementation of IaaS and facilitating portability between cloud implementations that support the specification. This talk will introduce the current work-in-progress CIMI specification and the initial implementation of that spec. as part of the Apache Deltacloud project.

SUMMARY:vcsh - manage config files in $HOME via fake bare git repositories
DESCRIPTION: So you have your system set up to work perfectly. But moving to new machines, adding or changing configs etc is hard and takes way too much time. Thus, you hacked up a common CVS/SVN/Git/whatever repository and soft-link into $HOME. There is a better way and it's called vcsh.

SUMMARY:Tumbler - A Modern D-Bus Thumbnail Service
DESCRIPTION: Tumbler is a D-Bus service that generates thumbnails for various kindsof applications. Clients can pick from several schedulers and thumbnailflavors depending on their needs. Tumbler provides a plugin interfacevia which the list of supported file types can be extended. It alreadyships thumbnail plugins for videos, fonts, images, ODF documents, PDF/PS documents and RAW images. Thanks to its support for delegating thumbnail request to specialized third-party services, Tumbler can alsobe used with closed source thumbnail generators.Originally written for Xfce and its Thunar file manager, Tumbler waslater integrated in MeeGo and is now used on the N9 as well. In thistalk, I will explain the features, design, and usage of Tumbler as wellas its current limitations. The ultimate goal is to make application anddesktop developers aware of it and motivate them to adopt Tumbler intheir software. The talk will include a live demonstration.

SUMMARY:IronPython: Bringing the dynamic world to the CLR
DESCRIPTION: "IronPython is a member of the relatively new family of dynamic languages running on top of .Net platform, aimed to be a fully compatible implementation of the Python language, and released by Microsoft under the Apache licence, making it one hundred percent free.The Python platform itself has a big and vibrant community, and stands as one of the best and most used dynamic languages int the FOSS world.  IronPython thus lets the .Net developers try this amazing language -being possible to smoothly invoke it from C# using the new dynamic features implemented as part of the 4.0 version-, and also lets the Python developers try the sweet bits behind the Mono and .Net platforms.I would be talking about the basics of IronPython, how it related to the standard implementation, how it interacts with C#, how to use the hosting API, and finally would take about a new IronPython addin for MonoDevelop I've been working in."

SUMMARY:OpenQA
DESCRIPTION: Testing is an important task. But testing daily development-snapshots of a Linux-distribution would mean testing the same things every day, which would be pretty tiresome to testers. Yet, no one likes to break his system with untested code.This presentation will be about my solution to this problem, using automated testing with KVM or VirtualBox for openQA.openSUSE.org to guarantee some minimum quality.  This will show some unique features like audio-testing, GUI-testing, and support for multiple distributions like Debian, Archlinux and Fedora. It will also have installation videos which are cool, fun and useful.

SUMMARY:Linux Containers and OpenVZ
DESCRIPTION: The talk is about operating system virtualization technology known as OpenVZ. This is an effective way of partitioning a Linux machine into multiple isolated Linux containers. All containers are running on top of one single Linux kernel, which results in excellent density, performance and manageability. The talk gives an overall description of OpenVZ building blocks, such as namespaces, cgroups and various resource controllers. A few features, notably live migration and virtual swap, are described in greater details. Results of some performance measurements against VMware, Xen and KVM are given. Finally, we will provide a status update on merging bits and pieces of OpenVZ kernel to upstream Linux kernel, and share our plans for the future.The talk is suitable for general audience, but will be of most interest to people interested in Linux kernel, resource management, virtualization, and cloud computing.

SUMMARY:Is copyleft being framed?
DESCRIPTION: This short talk will address the following questions, to inspirediscussion and contemplation about how we frame descriptions of thestate of licensing in free software.* Numbers are increasingly being cited to show that the use of copyleft licenses, specifically the GPL, is declining. What do these numbers actually show, who is propagating them, and why? What do or might other numbers show?* Is the "percentage of free software projects which use copyleft licenses" a useful way to judge the success of copyleft? Does an increase in the percentage of projects using non-copyleft permissive licenses indicate a failure of copyleft?* As a small related case study, what role have the licensing terms of popular mobile application stores played in this debate, and how have those terms changed the frame of the discussion?

SUMMARY:Infinispan: where open source, Java and in-memory data grids converge
DESCRIPTION: In today's cloudy world of highly scalable applications, the database is increasingly the common culprit for most performance and scalability bottlenecks.  NoSQL is often touted as the solution to your data storage woes, but data grids are a very viable alternative as well, providing both a performance boost to those using relational databases in the form of a distributed cache, but also as a primary key/value store.  However, open source is crucial too since such systems often comprise of lots of cheap commodity-hardware nodes.  Proprietary solutions based on per-CPU licensing models may scale in terms of transactions per second, but fail to scale financially.  And this is where Infinispan comes in: the open source in-memory data grid for the JVM.In this talk, Infinispan founder and project lead Manik Surtani will discuss the role of in-memory data grids in the Java ecosystem, in relation to cloud, PaaS and enterprise software.  Overlaps with NoSQL will also be discussed, as well as an update on JSR 107 and JSR 347, two JSRs that affect distributed caching and data grids.

SUMMARY:CAcert: Trust - the root of evil?!
DESCRIPTION: In a highly connected world like ours is trust one of the most important assets. But what if the root to trust is not trustworthy? 2011 was the year where one Certificate Authority (CA) after the other came to fall. The cases of the Dutch DigiNotar and the Malaysian  DigiCert are the best know. The system of commercial CAs depends on a wrong understanding of liability and trust. CAcert's web of trust tries to overcomes the liability issues by trusting a group of trusted people wherein each individual is liable for its own action. This talk enlightens why most commercial CAs are not trustworthy by default, what we can learn from 2011's cases, what makes CAcert different, why CAcert is not in the browsers by default and what we do to make it happen.

SUMMARY:Introducing Mutability Detector
DESCRIPTION: Mutability Detector is a lightweight static analysis tool for Java whichallows you to unit test for immutability. Using immutable objects is regarded asimproving readability of your Java code, and greatly simplifying multithreadedcode. However, without language support, it's all to easy to render classesmutable, and introduce the potential for subtle, hard to detect bugs. MutabilityDetector gives developers a way to write immutable classes, and help keep themimmutable.    Mutability Detector uses and depends on several free, open-source Javalibraries, such as Objectweb ASM. Also, being able to look at the source of theJDK, has greatly helped in improving the analysis.  The audience will learn of a simple little utility that may just help them intheir day-to-day development of Java. People can help out in the usual FLOSS way- using it, reporting bugs, giving feedback (especially the ways in which Isuck).

SUMMARY:Why mobile text input is hard
DESCRIPTION: Mobile text input requires easy copy'n'paste interaction, reliablecursor positioning and the ability to edit (or fix) previously writtentext. For Asian markets, computer-assisted input of composed charactersis of paramount importance. A virtual keyboard alone cannot solve that.For input methods to work, sophisticated platform and toolkitintegration is required.The current general-purpose APIs that come with their respective inputmethod modules in UI toolkits such as GTK+ and Qt are not sufficientlyequipped for these tasks. Although the situation within the toolkits isslowly improving, Maliit - a flexible and cross-platform input methodframework - can further narrow this functionality gap.This talk will analyze problems of mobile text input and show how theywere solved on Nokia's N9.

SUMMARY:Infrastructure as an open-source project
DESCRIPTION: I've been moving the site operations model of the Wikimedia infrastructure from being a closed, mainly staff-only, model to an open to all model of contributions. I'm treating operations like an open source project, using Puppet, OpenStack and Git. The bottleneck of the operations team is greatly lessened, allowing volunteer contributions to be accepted and implemented much faster.In this presentation, I'll describe the architecture of the Wikimedia Labs project, and how we are utilizing it to allow anyone to push changes from ideas to production. I'll also describe how this same model can apply to other open source projects, and also how it could apply more generally in private cloud implementations.

SUMMARY:Liberating ARM's Mali GPU.
DESCRIPTION: While everything is pretty much said and done on the x86 graphics front, and all the players have taken their respective positions and stick by it (despite ones best efforts), nothing has been done for the ARM world, even with the massive market penetration the linux and ARM combination currently has.The Mali is ARM's own GPU that is rapidly gaining traction. The most popular high end android smartphone so far is Samsung's Galaxy S2. The Mali-400 present in the Exynos SoC of the Galaxy S2 has been leader of the benchmarks for quite a bit. Besides the exynos, Mali is present in a rapidly growing number of SoCs, including telechips, allwinner, amlogic, realtek, VIA, ... The OpenGLES2.0 capable (and thus with separate vertex and fragment shaders) Mali is a highly clean design, and, of all the possible ARM GPUs, the perfect candidate for a free software driver.This talk will explain the rationale behind this project, the methodology used, the current status and the future direction. At the end, the current functionality (which is rapidly growing) will be demoed on both Mali-200 and Mali-400 based hardware. It will kick off a new era for free software graphics driver development.

SUMMARY:QA tools for FOSS distributions
DESCRIPTION: FOSS distributions are increasingly over pressure to deliver stable releases including the most up to date upstream software. Time-based release strategies has exacerbated this problem putting even more pressure on QA teams.The recently concluded Mancoosi project has developed a number of tools to automatically analyse large packages collections for a range of problems, frominstallability checks to speculative analysis of software repositories.In this talk I'll present four command line tools to identify and correct potential problems as soon as possible during the release cycle.

SUMMARY:Wayland
DESCRIPTION: Wayland is a new window system architecture aiming to be a good fit for everything from embedded and mobile devices to full-blown desktop environments. Wayland builds on most of the graphics driver, desktop and UI infrastructure we have today, but distills out just the display server functionality we actually use today. The toolkits, devicedrivers, compositors and desktop environments we use today all play their parts, but the X server is essentially reduced to an awkward, 500kloc IPC mechanism.In the talk we will look at where Wayland comes from, how our graphics stack has evolved to make Wayland feasible and the basics of how Wayland works. We are working towards a 1.0 release of the protocol libraries and the reference compositor, Weston, and we'll take a look at what will be in the release.

SUMMARY:Deploying OpenStack with the XCP toolstack on Ubuntu
DESCRIPTION: The Xen Cloud Platform (XCP) is an open source virtualization platform based on the Xen hypervisor. XCP isn't a server application which you install alongside of Xen, but rather an "embedded" appliance, which manages your host. While this gives XCP developers the ability to provide a tightly controlled, well integrated system, it makes it more difficult for FOSS developers to use and modify our software. To correct this, we have recently ported the XCP toolstack to run on Debian; it is currently in Debian unstable and will be in the next release of Ubuntu.In this presentation, we would like to demonstrate the XCP toolstack running on Ubuntu. We will show how easy it is to use the toolstack to create and manage virtual machines, and how you can use XCP and XenServer management tools with the XCP toolstack on Ubuntu. We will also demo our software running OpenStack.

SUMMARY:Garbage Collection Visualization, GCSpy and NetBeans in tandem
DESCRIPTION: We are recently witnesses of continuous performance improvements both in hardware and software worlds. However for systems with millions requests and users, performance is still very important. One of not that obvious performance optimizations is Garbage Collection selection and tuning. Garbage Collectors save us a lot of time and shield us from low level memory problems.However to take full advantage of Garbage Collection, we need to make the exploration process easy. Visualizing the Garbage Collection techniques (visualizing events, understanding memory abstraction and fragmentation, history observation) is critical for mentioned performance tuning, lowering the memory allocation, consumption and GC pauses.This talk will introduce Garbage Collection in nutshell, but especially abstractions and terms defined in GCSpy project and summarize the porting process of GCSpy to NetBeans platform. We will look at advantages of NetBeans platform, summarize faced challenges and current status of the project and further ideas.I am looking for ideas to improve the GC visualization even more, other VM support (at least partial) and architecture overview.

SUMMARY:Panel on Application Stores
DESCRIPTION: So-called "app stores" are becoming a popular means of distributingsoftware, particularly for mobile devices. However, the rise of appstores has been accompanied by tensions with free software/open sourcelegal norms. Companies controlling official app distribution channelsfor their platforms typically place restrictive terms on both usersand developers in ways that may be difficult or impossible toharmonize with requirements and expectations around FLOSSlicensing. Moreover, there is a perception that noncompliance withFLOSS licenses is prevalent in app store distribution. This panel willexplore some of the problems arising out of the intersection betweenapp stores and FLOSS, under EU as well as US law, and will discusspossible solutions.

SUMMARY:Thermostat: Taking over the Java tooling world with Open Source Software
DESCRIPTION: One area in which proprietary JDK releases have traditionally showed superiority over OpenJDK is in monitoring and instrumentation tools.  We aim to overcome this shortcoming and even reverse the trend by introducing a new, scalable tool to the the ecosystem: Thermostat.  During the last half year, we've been quietly coming up with a plan for how this tool should work, and we're now ready to share what we've come up with.  By working with others in the open Java community, we believe that we can make the most useful, most comprehensive, and all around best application of its kind.In our presentation, we will describe our extensible model for collecting JVM and system monitoring data side by side.  Attendees will learn about the features we have planned, see a short demo of what is already working, and hopefully be inspired to join us in in making this awesome tool a reality.

SUMMARY:Boot to Gecko and Web API
DESCRIPTION: Boot2Gecko (B2G) is a complete OS built on the open web platform.  Every "app" from the lock screen to the phone dialer is a "web app", built with HTML/JS/CSS.  Where we encounter gaps in the open web platform as compared to other phone OSes, we plug the gaps with new Web APIs, to be standardized by web standards bodies.  If you know how to write a web page, you will be able to write phone apps.  B2G is developed according to Mozilla's values: in the open, with source code always available, and on open standards.  In this talk, we'll discuss the motivation for B2G and some of its implementation.  And of course, there will be a demo!

What happens if your business experts want to add a workflow action to send a mail upon each mortgage approval above 100 000 € with an applicant below age 30? How long does it take to hit production? Can the business experts easily read the changes before they hit production?With Guvnor and the jBPM designer, those business experts can write and edit the workflows and business rules themselves. They can verify them and put them in poduction.

SUMMARY:I wrote Distromatch, shall we use it?
DESCRIPTION: At the [AppInstaller2011](http://distributions.freedesktop.org/wiki/Meetings/AppInstaller2011) meeting I started writing [Distromatch](http://www.enricozini.org/2011/debian/distromatch/) which is able to map binary package names across different distribution using a wide set of euristics.Distromatch has the potential of being a radical change in cross-distro cooperation, enabling exchange of package screenshots, categories, ratings, reviews and many other interesting kinds of metadata.Since distromatch has existed for almost a year and (afaik) so far none of this has happened, I am taking advantage of the cross-distro room to show how it works and discuss how to move on from here.

SUMMARY:PMD5: What can it do for you ?
DESCRIPTION: This lightning talk will be an overview of the important features of PMD 5.0, from which a beta should be release before then.Introducing briefly what PMD does (static code control and analysis) and how it does it (using XPath to query over Abstract Syntax Tree provided by pre-compilation), the talk will focus on the more important enhancement of this version: multi language support, mostly achieved by the great work of Ryan Gustavson between 2009 - 2010. With this features, PMD can be easily extend to support a large set of languages, including already XML based languages and ECMAScript (more commonly designated by the name JavaScript)

SUMMARY:Tracing, Debugging and Testing With Byteman 
DESCRIPTION: The Hotspot/OpenJDK Java agent capability and its associated java.lang.instrument API provide support for runtime bytecode transformation, either initially at class load time or, since JDK6, retrospectively after classes have been loaded and instantiated. This API has been adopted as a de facto standard by several other industrial strength JVMs. The uses of this API extend far beyond simple code instrumentation and suggest that more widespread adoption of the OpenJDK Java agent model and use of Java agents is highly desirable.Byteman is a Java agent program and suite of associated tools which supports tracing, monitoring and testing of Java applications via bytecode transformation. This has many advantages over conventional approaches, in particular being much more flexible and far less invasive. This talk will demonstrate Byteman in action showing you how to install and run it both standalone from the java command line and integrated with the JUnit and TestNG test frameworks driven from ant or maven. The examples progress from injecting simple debug trace to displaying a timing bug in a multi-threaded application.Along the way you should learn how Java agent programs work and how much freedom they have to manipulate the JVM runtime. I hope to encourage many of you to use Byteman and to contribute suggestions for new features. Also, maybe a few of you will be inspired to implement your own agent programs or to provide support for agents in other JVMs.

SUMMARY:Creative Commons 4.0 licenses and other opportunities for FLOSS/free culture legal/policy intersections
DESCRIPTION: Creative Commons has since its launch in 2002 acknowledged freesoftware as an inspiration, but in-depth communication and understandingacross the "free culture" (and education, science, government...) andfree software movements has been thin, resulting in missed opportunities(at least on the free culture side).  Two developments make early 2012 anopportune and necessary time to address this. First, Creative Commons haskicked off a process which will eventually lead to the release of version4.0 of various CC licenses, which ought incorporate the best wisdom aboutpublic licenses (most of which resides in the free software community)and not need to be versioned again for a decade. Additionally, among theissues under discussion for CC 4.0 licenses are ones of direct import tothe free software community, including how DRM and license compatibilityare addressed. Second, CC licenses have become fairly widely adopted aspolicy for public sector and publicly interested materials and funding,especially in education. Free software and even open standards areinadequately accounted for these developments, presenting a significant andunappreciated threat to the realization of public benefit from such --a continuation of the tendency of free culture (with the exception ofWikimedia) being dependent on proprietary web silos. This talk will verybriefly summarize the relevant history, describe the pertinent CC 4.0licenses and policy issues, and hopefully provoke solutions and actionsbenefiting free software and free culture.

SUMMARY:Wazaabi - Model your UI ... live
DESCRIPTION: UI development usually consists in building software components that rely on a business data model. But business data models need to change frequently to adapt user requirement updates. This implies to adapt frequently the UI components.Nowadays, existing solutions provide a way to support these changes by providing code generation and data binding. But, these solutions are still slow. Then, the development cost increases rapidly if you have frequently requirement updates and/or many UI components.Wazaabi aims to reduce this cost by providing a solution based on models which doesn't require code generation. Based on Eclipse EMF, Wazaabi provides an open source framework that implements a dynamic declarative UI mechanism. The Wazaabi framework is directly based on the business data model and will evolve with it.This presentation aims to give a look inside this framework.

SUMMARY:GNOME 3.4 accessible: Status, news, future
DESCRIPTION: In GNOME, accessibility is a core value that touches all aspects ofthe system. [1]From the infrastructure, to the graphical toolkit, to theapplications, to the assistive technologies, accessibility has been acentral consideration from the very early days.On April 2011 GNOME 3.0 was released, and although GNOME and theaccessibility made a huge effort, the accessibility support was notideal. But not are bad news. Finally the accessibility technologiesare starting to be used from the two main free desktops. AT-SPI isstarting to be used on KDE distros, and Orca is starting to befunctional with Qt apps. Since GNOME 3.0 a big effort was done inorder to improve the situation. At the moment of this proposal writingan ATK/AT-SPI2 hackfest is being organized, in order to fix the issuesfrom the framework itself.The purpose of this presentation is explaining:  * Introduce accessibility on GNOME.  * Briefly explain the status towards GNOME 3.4  * Summarize the output of the ATK/AT-SPI2 hackfest  * Compare GNOME 3.0 vs GNOME 3.4  * KDE status and cooperation  * Future[1] http://library.gnome.org/devel/accessibility-devel-guide/nightly/gad-how-it-works.html.en

SUMMARY:Apache Giraph: distributed graph processing in the cloud
DESCRIPTION: Web and online social graphs have been rapidly growing in size and scale during the past decade. In 2008, Google estimated that the number of web pages reached over a trillion. Online social networking and email sites, including Yahoo!, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter, have hundreds of millions of users and are expected to grow much more in the future. Processing these graphs plays a big role in relevant and personalized information for users, such as results from a search engine or news in an online social networking site.The Apache Giraph [1] project is a fault-tolerant in-memory distributed graph processing system which runs on top of a standard Hadoop [2] cluster and is capable of running any standard Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) operation over any large generic data set which can be represented as a graph. Apache Giraph is a loose implementation of Google Pregel but can be added to any Hadoop job pipeline as a normal MapReduce job. Giraph entered the ASF Incubator in July 2011, where it has enlisted the aid of committers from Yahoo!, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter.The talk will describe why running iterative MapReduce jobs for graph processing is not well suited for typical MapReduce jobs, introducing the reason why Google designed Pregel at first place. Next, the BSP model and how it is applied to graph processing will be explained. The last part of the talk will be dedicated to Apache Giraph, with a description of the programming model (i.e. the API, some typical examples such as PageRank and Single Source Shortest Path) along with a technical overview of how the architecture of Giraph works and how it leverages the Hadoop infrastructure.

SUMMARY:Introduction to the NOVA kernel API
DESCRIPTION: The NOVA virtualization architecture is comprised of amicrohypervisor and a capability-based multiserver userland with aspecific focus on enabling secure and efficient virtualization using x86hardware virtualization extensions (VT-x, VT-d, SR-IOV). It does so bymoving almost all of the actual "virtualization" into a per-VM userspacecomponent that is not in the Trusted Computing Base of other virtualmachines. This talk will give an overview of NOVA's unique executionmodel and API with a strong focus on how this enables efficientexecution of a VMM. Specifically, this talk will cover how tasks andthreads are realized in NOVA, how communication between threads works,how VM exits are handled in NOVA and how this extends to SMP machines.

SUMMARY:USB redirection over the network
DESCRIPTION: USB redirection is using USB devices attached to a real machine inside a virtual machine (guest).The focus of the talk will be the special case where the USB device being redirected is not attachedto the physical machine hosting the virtual machine, but to some other machine. The talk will presentand discuss the ongoing work to create an FOSS solution for this, getting this merged into upstreamqemu, as well is integrating this into Spice and the Spice-client.The intended audience are people who are interested in usb in virtual machines (vusb) bothdevelopers and users. The audience is expected to be familiar with generic virtualization concepts,but no deep technical knowledge is required.

DESCRIPTION: Developers comfortable with Moose typically look back on their first projects and cringe at some of the more naive choices made simply because they were unaware of better ways. Learn to avoid some common pitfalls and save time with knowing: when to use delegation and when to use role composition, common MooseX namespaced modules that simplify implementation, native attribute traits, and designing with an eye toward Inversion of Control.

SUMMARY:CoApp: Packaging Open Source software for Windows
DESCRIPTION: Open Source Software has long enjoyed the ability to be trivially acquired, installed and maintained on Linux via packages, where each package contains within it all the information required to find and configure the necessary dependencies.    However, in many situations there is a strong need to install OSS on Windows,where traditional package management systems like RPM and DPKG are not only unavailable--but couldn't support the platform in a manner consistent with the other software.This presentation looks into the technical details of CoApp, a new fully-open source package management system fills this gap by providing all the tools to easily create, publish, discover, and install software packages, including automatically handling dependencies, managing updates and providing a frictionless end-user experience, all in a method that is well supported by the platform.

DESCRIPTION: Many open source hackers see the allure of building applications that integrate with the telephone network.  However layers of industry jargon, proprietary technology and arcane knowledge lead many to believe that telephony is "hard."  Adhearsion will change their minds.  The Adhearsion project is an open source voice application development framework, the first of its kind in the open source world.  In this talk we will build several working voice applications and demonstrate how to integrate them with external services.  Along the way, we will discuss voice application design and show how to avoid common pitfalls.

SUMMARY:eLuaBrain: a 32-bit MCU based educational computer
DESCRIPTION: eLuaBrain is an experiment in educational computers with a number ofunique features. It is a low cost, completely autonomous computerdesigned to work with low cost peripherals (PS/2 keyboard on input anda standard VGA monitor on output). Its main goal is to offer anotherperspective on education in general and training IT professionals inparticular. Modern computers are difficult to understand at thehardware level even for experienced IT professionals; at the sametime, there is a growing trend in most modern computer languages tocompletely ignore the hardware on which they run and focus entirely onprogramming concepts instead. By contrast, eLuaBrain offers the wholeexperience in a single package. Its hardware is easy to understand(and hack) and the on-board software offers easy ways to interact withthe hardware, thanks to the features provided by the eLua open sourceproject. eLua is built around the programming language Lua, which is arelatively compact language, but comes packed with lots of features,which makes it very suitable for teaching programming concepts. WitheLuaBrain it is natural to teach programming and hardware design inparallel, which gives students a complete image on thehardware-software interactions.At the hardware level, it is built around a 32-bit CPU (a Cortex-M3core) with 1M of external RAM. It also features TCP/IP networkconnectivity, SD card storage and a low power radio link. eLua bringsa MCU-friendly Lua interpreter and hardware support modules into theequation, while the built-in code editor and on-line help system makeeLuaBrain a truly autonomous platform. A very low footprint, UDP basedremote file system can be used to easily share files with any desktopmachine.The hardware and software behind eLuaBrain are open source, free touse for both commercial and non-commercial projects. eLuaBrain comeswith a number of sample applications meant to demonstrate the platformfeatures and to serve as a starting point for future applications.These include a RSS reader, an IRC client, a Web server and (ofcourse) games.This presentation will start with an overview of eLua, after whichwe'll take a deeper look at the implementation of eLuaBrain at bothhardware and software level and its future directions of development.If time allows and the right hardware is in place, a live demo of theplatform will also be provided.

SUMMARY:Dealing with JVM limitations in Apache Cassandra 
DESCRIPTION: The Cassandra distributed database runs on the JVM, which in many waysis a huge productivity boost. However, the more you care aboutperformance, the less you can afford to let abstractions like i/o andmemory management exist as black boxes.This talk will cover how Cassandra has gone beyond the interfacesprovided by the JVM to achieve higher performance in three areas.First, how Cassandra uses platform-specific features such asposix_fadvise, munmap, and mlock.  Second, how we tune memorymanagement to avoid pain points in common garbage collection designs,including in OpenJDK. Third, how Cassandra uses the JDK'sinstrumentation hooks to measure the real size of on-heap structuresand make better decisions about what to keep in memory withouterror-prone manual adjustments.

SUMMARY:Introduction of the Genode OS Framework
DESCRIPTION: Today's operating systems try to find a balance between seeminglyconflicting goals. Ease of use is traded against security, resourceutilization is traded against resource accountability, and systemcomplexity is traded against scalability. For example, SELinux is illfamed as hard to use and consequently remains widely unused. As anotherexample, isolation kernels minimize the complexity of critical systemsoftware but at the cost of limiting these solutions to static applications.The Genode OS architecture shows how these apparently inherent conflictscan be solved by operating-system design.

SUMMARY:Using Cascalog and Hadoop for rapid graph processing and exploration 
DESCRIPTION: Graphs are becoming increasingly popular as ways of modeling a wide variety of systems. As such, the label "graph processing" also covers a range of objectives and architectural constraints.At [Linkfluence][http://us.linkfluence.net/], we use graph processing on datasets produced with very different systems (Web crawler, Twitter and Facebook API, feed aggregator, etc.) We spend a lot of time doing exploratory programming, trying to use our eclectic datasets in interesting ways, and processing our data in asynchronous workflows.We have come to see [Hadoop][http://hadoop.apache.org/] and the processing framework [Cascalog][https://github.com/nathanmarz/cascalog] as essential tools in our toolbox when dealing with graphs, since it gives us architectural flexibility, scalability and the possibility of rapid prototyping.Cascalog is an open source framework built on top of Hadoop and [Cascading][http://www.cascading.org/]. Its syntactic and semantic roots come from Datalog and Prolog, which have been succesfully applied for a long time in the manipulation of graphs. Also, its ability to directly embed the expressive [Clojure][http://clojure.org/] language allows to very easily definecustom operations and ad-hoc processing.In this talk, we will present the framework, consider its advantages and drawbacks when compared to other approaches, show concrete exemples of usage for graph processing and how we use them to complement graph databases.

SUMMARY:Tracking Firefox performance via Telemetry
DESCRIPTION: Traditionally Mozilla measured Firefox performance with a set of performance tests called Talos. For features not covered by Talos developers benchmarked individual features themselves.However, it turns it is extremely difficult to design a representative testsuite. Reproducing performance problems is often harder than fixing them.Telemetry is a way to measure Firefox performance & usage in the field. It allows developers to insert lightweight probes and then use them to track how Firefox behaves in the wild. We have been using Telemetry to improve Firefox since version 7. We will soon roll out Telemetry to addon developers so they can benefit from the same infrastructure. This talk will cover how Telemetry is used and the kinds of problems it helped us fix so far.

SUMMARY:Data-Driven and Component-Based Game-Entities 
DESCRIPTION: Game architectures used to be designed in an inheritance-based approach, which has proven to be difficult. The current state-of-the-art is a component-based architecture that allows loading all game entities from a separate data source. This enables easier testing and modularization of the code.It is also beneficial for the game designer as it weakens the game designer's dependency on the programmer. This is important for content creators of open-source games, so they can easily add their new content to the game, without relying on somebody else to help them.This talk will outline the reasons to use a data-driven and component-based architecture, give examples of architectures used in popular open-source games (Wesnoth, MegaGlest, 0AD and Unknown Horizons) and explain how Unknown Horizons moved from an inheritance-based approach to the new component-based architecture.

SUMMARY:Caching and Tuning fun for high scalability
DESCRIPTION: Caching has been a 'hot' topic for a few years. But caching takes more than merely taking data and putting it in a cache : the right caching techniques can improve performance and reduce load significantly. But we'll also look at some major pitfalls, showing that caching the wrong way can bring down your site. If you're looking for a clear explanation about various caching techniques and tools like Memcached, Nginx and Varnish, as well as ways to deploy them in an efficient way, this talk is for you. In this talk, we'll start from a Zend Framework (PHP) based site. We'll add caching, begin to add servers and replace the standard LAMP stack, all while performing live benchmarks.

SUMMARY:Being a good upstream - the syslog-ng PoV
DESCRIPTION: For many years, syslog-ng was part of many distributions but stuck at ancient software versions. My task was to help distributions to update their syslog-ng packages and now to keep them updated. This is a two way process, as while distros receive many help, we also get a lot of useful feedback and ideas, which influence the development of syslog-ng.Using syslog-ng as an example, I'll try to show how upstream can work with distributions for the benefit of both sides.

SUMMARY:Towards a BSD C++11 Stack 
DESCRIPTION: FreeBSD 10 is expected to have a completely new C++ stack.  The reasons for this are partly legal and partly technical.  The existing stack is covered by version 2 of the GPL, but newer versions from upstream are GPLv3.  The new C++11 standard means that shipping an old version of the GNU stack is no longer acceptable.  This talk will cover the various parts that were required for replacing this stack, the challenges and missing pieces that needed implementing and the advantages of the new stack.

SUMMARY:Aseba robot programming
DESCRIPTION: Aseba is an open-source project providing a set of tools thatallow beginners to program robots easily and efficiently.Technically speaking, Aseba is an event-based architecture fordistributed control of mobile robots. It targets single- ormulti-processor robots and simulations. The core of Aseba is alightweight virtual machine tiny enough to run onmicrocontrollers. With Aseba, we program robots in aoctave-style scripting language using an integrated developmentenvironment. This environment provides several featuresimportant for robotics, such as real-time inspection ofsensor/actuator data, integrating plotting, on-typingcompilation, distributed debugging, and instant code upload tothe robot. Compared to alternatives (for instance Arduino andLego Mindstorm), Aseba focuses on text-based programming buttakes advantage of the tight integration between the environmentand the robot to provide an interactive robot programmingexperience.Aseba stems from research in miniature mobile robotics, in whichsmall robots with multiple microcontrollers have risenarchitectural questions (see papers under links). In addition,Aseba has found a natural application in educational roboticswith the Thymio low-cost robot. We have also demonstrated Asebain simulation and on a group of e-puck robots. Aseba integrateswith D-Bus and ROS, allowing access to microcontrollers fromhigh-level languages.I am the initiator and maintainer of the Aseba technology andone of the most active contributors. I propose to present a talkwith the following content: * Genesis, why did we develop such a thing. * Technical overview, with discussion of the design choices. * Presentation of the Aseba in the robotic-research context. * Live demonstration of Aseba in the educational context using  the Thymio robot. * Future directions. * Conclusion and question answering.I started developing Aseba as part of my PhD work in the Mobotsresearch group at EPFL. Currently, a community comprisingmembers of the Mobots group, of the mobsya association, of theASL at ETH Zürich and other individuals maintain and furtherdevelop Aseba.

SUMMARY:Introduction to HelenOS
DESCRIPTION: HelenOS is a general-purpose multiserver operating system written from scratch. It is based on a custom microkernel, SPARTAN, which currently runs on seven different CPU architectures (ARM, IA-32, x86-64, Itanium, MIPS, PowerPC and SPARC V9) . Most system services (e.g. device drivers, file systems, networking) are implemented in regular user-space processes which communicate via asynchronous messaging.First, the talk will briefly introduce the HelenOS project history and community structure. Second, we will briefly talk about the major technical areas and specifics of the system (boot and kernel, IPC mechanisms and naming services, devices and filesystems). This part will be supported by demos of the running system as well as by showing the structure of the source code. Last, we will look at what functionality is already there, what is currently being actively worked on and what are the future plans, which aim toward making the system self-hosting.

SUMMARY:Working with contributor communities (round table)
DESCRIPTION: Several distribution projects have existing initiatives and programs in order to coordinate and/or fund local communities as well as shipping or producing promotional material, going to events to promote the project, etc...Some projects are currently looking into setting up something like this, and others are rethinking their current model.Those programs all have their differences, but achieve pretty similar goals.In this session, we will bring together a bunch of people from different projects who are in charge or actively participating in such initiatives, in order to briefly present what they are currently doing in their project and, more importantly, share experience about what has worked well and what hasn't in an open discussion session.Let's learn from each others' ideas and mistakes.

SUMMARY:Build simple and complex replication clusters with Tungsten Replicator
DESCRIPTION: Tired of the intricacies of circular replication? Dreaming of real multiple masters solutions for MySQL replication? Dream no more. Tungsten Replicator, a free and open source replacement for MySQL replication, can build clusters of asynchronous nodes in a matter of minutes. This workshop will explain the basics of Tungsten Replicator, and it will show how to start your multiple master cluster in a few minutes. There will be examples of several topologies: from the simplest bi-directional replication to the ambitious all-to-all (every node is a master), fan-in (multiple masters to a single slave), the star (a central hub connected to several bi-directional masters)

SUMMARY:Can I legally do that?
DESCRIPTION: Often when people ask the question "Can I legally do that?", they mean"Will someone sue me if I do...?". Sadly the answer is that if somethingis successful, no matter what and how you did things, at some pointsomeone will just try and sue, just to see if they can get some part ofthe success/money.This talk will describe some of the copyright, trademark and patentissues a Free Software hacker dealing with the core java platform mayencounter. And some techniques we as a community can employ to make thechances of individual hackers being the target of a lawsuit smaller andhow to make it harder for someone to take down one of our core javaplatform projects.

SUMMARY:The Dynamic Data Driven Worlds of WorldForge
DESCRIPTION: The WorldForge Project was founded in 1998 on many dreams of online world with freedom, both in terms of price and from the constraints of proprietary software.Pulled in many different directions by often conflicting visions of what the perfect online role playing game should be, the developers have been forced to come up with novel solutions allowing unprecedented flexibility to both the game designer and the player. Using data driven and procedural technologies, systems have been developed that remove the need for gigabytes of patches that are associated with proprietary commercial titles, and allow every host to configure their own game rules in a unique world.In this talk one of the projects longest standing programs will describe some of these technologies, including the possibilities they unlock and examples of their use.

SUMMARY:How Eclipse Works
DESCRIPTION: By any measure, Eclipse has been a very successful open source community, and it has certainly contributed immensely to the worldwide success of Java. It has also been for many years, one of best examples of a vendor-neutral, free Java community.But there is one thing in particular that sets Eclipse apart: it ALWAYS ships on time. For eight straight years, the Eclipse community has shipped its major release on time to the day. How the heck does that work? This talk will focus on the processes, community interactions, and most importantly, the cultural aspects of Eclipse that makes this possible. The not-so-subliminal message is that OpenJDK would be well served to emulate Eclipse in its predictability.

SUMMARY:Safe upgrade of embedded systems
DESCRIPTION: After deploying an embedded system, it is desirable to be able to upgrade the firmware, in order to add new features or to solve bugs. However, it is often difficult and expensive for a technician to get physical access to the device(s). Therefore, it should be possible to perform the upgrade remotely, which also means that it should be secure and survive any kind of failure. In the course of their career the consultants at Essensium/Mind have encountered many failure paths and solutions of how to deal with them. This includes issues like bad firmware, power failure, communication problems, security issues, flash corruption and bootloader bugs. Solutions include fall-back firmware, watchdogs, journalling filesystems, backup media and package managers. But in the end, it turns out that there is no silver bullet and that the best upgrade approach mostly depends on how the system is used.

SUMMARY:Optimising SQL applications by using client side tools
DESCRIPTION: Much is discussed regarding query optimisers within database server, attention is not always paid however to the actual queries that are passed to a database server to execute and the value of those queries within an application context.No matter how good a query optimiser is it can not match the performance improvement that can be gained by not running a particular query at all, retrieving smaller result sets or running queries less frequently.We will discuss some methods to investigate the SQL your application is sending to your MySQL server, and examine some techniques to visualise the cost of the interactions your application has with the MySQL database.

SUMMARY:Pandora - a mobile Linux computer including gaming controls
DESCRIPTION: The Pandora is a handheld produced to run Linux. It's not only a gaming device (it features gaming controls), but basically a full Mini-Linux PC the size of a Nintendo DS. It has come a long ways and many many issues occurred during the production. The mass production will finally start in Germany in February, making it easily available for everyone. This talk will give a small introduction to those who don't know what the Pandora is, explaining a bit about the history and the community behind it as well as showing what it can do.

SUMMARY:Graphity: an efficient neo4j based graph model for retrieving the top k news feeds for users in social networks 
DESCRIPTION: You can find more information about it in my blog article: http://www.rene-pickhardt.de/graphity-an-efficient-graph-model-for-retrieving-the-top-k-news-feeds-for-users-in-social-networks/ and a demo can be found at http://gwt.metalcon.de/GWT-Modelling/#Home A key challenge of web platforms like social networking sites and services for news feed aggregation is the efficient and targeted distribution of new content items to the users. This can be formulated as the problem of retrieving the top-k news items out of the d-degree ego network of each given user, where the set of all users producing feeds is of size n, with n ≫ d ≫ k and typically k < 20. Existing approaches employ either expensive join operations on global indices or suffer from high redundancy through denormalization. This makes retrieving of different top-k news item sets for thousands of users per second very inefficient in a large network. In this paper, we propose a novel index GRAPHITY to remedy this problem. The GRAPHITY index is based on neo4j and allows retrieval of the top-k news items from a user’s ego network independent of the node degree of his ego network, thus reducing join efforts. In addition to efficient top-k retrieval, GRAPHITY does not introduce any redundancies in the content data.We prove that updates of the index are in O(1) and adding a new content item is linear in the user’s indegree. We compare the theoretical run time complexity of GRAPHITY against several baselines on two data sets of different characteristics and size. Our evaluation confirms that GRAPHITY is independent of the node degree d and network size n. In addition, GRAPHITY significantly outperforms the baselines in retrieving the news feeds as our theoretical examination predicted.

SUMMARY:Ultralightweight Kernel Service Virtualization with Rump Kernels
DESCRIPTION: Existing virtualization solutions such as Xen, QEMU and usermode operating systems virtualize the entire OS.  While this is useful in a machine room type of use case, it is unnecessarily heavyweight when the interest is in virtualizing only one kernel driver or one kernel service.This talk introduces the anykernel architecture and rump kernels, which allow to safely virtualize individual drivers and subsystems from a monolithic kernel. Rump kernels can be used in a variety of different configurations, such as an application library, a microkernel style server, or as a server over the Internet.We will go over a number of real world use cases and present results which show that in their application domain rump kernels are faster, smaller and more agile than full OS virtualization technologies.

SUMMARY:The microkernel overhead
DESCRIPTION: Since the famous [Tanenbaum-Torvalds debate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanenbaum–Torvalds_debate) the general public sticks to the golden rule of thumb: Microkernel systems, while nice and elegant, are just academic toys. Due to the infamous communication overhead and other self-imposed limitations, they are never going to be as useful for the general use (in terms of performance) as the good old monolithic systems.Since the 1990s many researchers (especially the people around L4) have struggled to lower the overhead using the most extraordinary tricks. Others have tried to apply the microkernel design to mission critical, safety critical and other niche targets, where the benefits of the microkernel design clearly outweights the drawbacks. And other folks spent years creating hybrid systems to get the best (and hopefully not the worst) of the both worlds.But are the drawbacks of the microkernels fundamental?

SUMMARY:A strategy for managing diverse equipment in the CERN controls group
DESCRIPTION: The CERN accelerator control systems access equipment distributed over ageographic area tens of kilometers across.  When off the shelf hardware is not available engineers design and prototype I/Odevices as needed. With the advent of the open hardware repository, collaborations between the physics laboratories, research institutes and industry now ensure high quality designs and generality. The manufacture ofthese devices may be tendered out to industry and the companies involved arefree to add them to their own catalogs.   The control system requires very precise timing and synchronization of controland acquisition values over a large area and a diverse array of configurableequipment connected to the accelerators. Great care is required to manage thecontrol system timing and configuration so that remote FPGA cores are set up correctly.The “White-Rabbit” timing project is open and addresses the future timingand synchronization needs for CERN and other laboratories. White-rabbit makesuse of synchronous Ethernet and uses ideas from IEEE 1588 PTP protocol to synchronize remote equipment up to 10Km apart to better than one nanosecond.   Various control system devices at different geographic locations will have onboard FPGA logic loaded dynamically by carrier FMC device drivers with configuration data. Device specific drivers then scan the FPGA configurationvia a Wishbone-standard bus to determine the installation and if any further configuration is needed.   Etherbone is a software extension of the Wishbone hardware standard permittingremote FPGA cores to communicate with each other and with other control systemcomponents.The variety of I/O peripherals, their wide range of activation modeand the requirement to move several megabytes of data per channel persecond is managed by ZIO, a new I/O framework designed to handlethe usual I/O channels but also pulse generation and sampling; allperipherals may also be white-rabbit-aware, so that their owntimestamps are more precise than what the host computer can offer.Although ZIO examples drive simple I/O channels, the system is ableto DMA directly to user space, to sustain high data rates.

SUMMARY:The Lua Scripting Language in the NetBSD Kernel
DESCRIPTION: The Lua scripting language has been designed to be embedded into software written in C to allow for scripting and extending of such software. Lua is popular because it is easy to integrate and the language itself is simple and easy to learn. The compact code size and small memory footprint make it a candidate for embedded use.Most Lua use cases are to extend end-user software, like e.g. the popular game "World of Warcraft" or the photo editing and archiving software "Adobe Lightroom". In this presentation, however, the author will show how Lua can be used in an operating system kernel. An actual implementation will be presented based on the NetBSD Unix-like open source operating system.

SUMMARY:How to trick a developer into being a designer?
DESCRIPTION: We can't get anywhere with free software if the developers don't dodesign. They always did. It just sucked because they went with whateverthe first iteration was. The focal point changed and "we'll add some UIlater" is not design. Interaction with the software is key. Design requires you to have a general idea about the interactionupfront, but not everything. Once a general idea is out there an agreedupon, the second part of the design process kicks in."Prototyping"Prototypes help you see the flaws of a design more clearly, and missingfeatures can be added to accelerate the design/development of theproject. Frequent and agile iterations between visual designing &prototyping is part of a healthy design process.Since developers can write code they can also prototype, (as long asthey don't get attached to their code).This talk is about how designers tricked a developer to be one ofthem...

SUMMARY:Spoon, a minimal object programming system
DESCRIPTION:       Spoon? Spoon! It's a minimal object programming system derived from Squeak, with new approaches to organization, collaboration, and deployment. Spoon is the system I want for writing and distributing software. Initially, it has only that needed for a new programmer to start and extend it easily. This includes a module system, with which any Spoon system may provide code and data to others. Each module is a live object, and coordinates the direct synchronization of providing and consuming systems. The very smallest object memory snapshot I've made is 1,337 bytes long. An interesting intermediate result of this work has been "session imprinting", the transfer of compiled methods directly from one system to another as a side-effect of running them, without needing to compile source code.

SUMMARY:Tracing and virtualization workshop, millikernels and anykernels
DESCRIPTION: There are tons of virtualization projects based on tracing: user-mode linux, umview/kmview, fakeroot-ng, cde.Ptrace is ugly and old but fundamentals tools rely on it: gdb, strace. New tracing facilities like uprobes, lttng and systemtap have been designed mainly (only) for debugging, not for virtualization. In the meanwhile there are new efforts to create more flexible kernels: anykernels and millikernels. These new approaches need a specific support: hooks, hypercall or tracing. It does not matter how we call it. Utrace is (was) an option, with some minor effort at kernel level, even classic ptrace could be implemented at user level for back compatibility.The workshop wants to be a technologically agnostic discussion on tracing supports for virtualization and for new flexible kernels.All contributors of new ideas are welcome to the open discussion.

SUMMARY:Automated Distribution Development and Maintenance
DESCRIPTION: Presenting tools and workflows used via Open Build Service by various distributions to develop the distribution. This includes automated source processing, validation, QA, automated and manual reviews.Additional focus point on maintenance handling, means updates after a distribution is released which are usually done in a complete different way.I like to have a discussion about the question how distributions should validate trustable sources and how the trust can be increased by a common distro effort.

SUMMARY:Optimizing your innodb buffer pool usage
DESCRIPTION: Many of the MySQL servers now support inspection of the InnoDB buffer pool contents. Since effective usage of the InnoDB buffer pool is critical to good MySQL performance, a look into what is in your buffer pool is an effective tool to optimize your table layout and index usage for optimal performance. The presentation shows how to use this information to create efficient tables and indexes by looking at your buffer pool contents.

SUMMARY:Implementing Domain-Specific Languages with LLVM 
DESCRIPTION: Any sufficiently complex application eventually evolves its own scripting framework or domain-specific language.  These can be simple things, like a graphical scripting language for connecting pre-existing building blocks together, a domain-specific language for performing image convolutions, or a general-purpose language like a Lisp or JavaScript dialect for writing extensions.These are usually implemented as ad-hoc interpreters, which limits their utility things that are not performance critical.  With LLVM, it is very easy to turn a quick-and-dirty interpreter into a high-speed JIT or static compiler.  This talk will explain how to plug LLVM into your application and allow code in your scripting language to run (almost) as fast as compiled C.LLVM is a set of libraries that can be assembled to build compilers and related tools.  This talk will give a close look at some of the APIs, the core abstractions that they present, and how they are used.

SUMMARY:pkgsrc on MirBSD
DESCRIPTION: pkgsrc is a collection of over 11,000 packages available for a variety of operating systems, developed by the NetBSD project. Since the end of 2010, there is an ongoing effort to port pkgsrc to MirOS BSD, an operating system derived from OpenBSD. This talk gives a short overview over pkgsrc, comparing its usage and features to MirPorts, the older "native" packages system on MirOS. Compared to MirPorts, pkgsrc has many more and newer packages, a more active community of developers and a very responsive security team that identifies and patches vulnerable packages. Some more practical aspects will also be treated: how to get a new platform supported in pkgsrc (both on the technical and on the administrative side) and which are the principal challenges in doing so.

SUMMARY:MySQL creatively in a sandbox
DESCRIPTION: Problem: you want to test many different builds of MySQL. There is a proliferation of MySQL versions and builds. Working as a DBA or as a consultant, you will find large installations of MySQL 5.0 to 5.5, with subtle variations among them. In the same company there may several versions of MySQL 5.1, or you may find a mix of vanilla MySQL and Percona or MariaDB builds. For all these version, you often need to reproduce a problem using the same version being used in production, and often you need to install several test servers in the same host for this purpose. Then there are the work-in-progress versions that Oracle and other companies are producing. And you want to test them before adopting them. For all the above needs, there is MySQL Sandbox, a versatile tool that allows you to install multiple servers in the same host, no matter if they are the same version or different ones. This workshop will explain quickly how MySQL Sandbox works, and then show with practical examples how to test several combinations of servers in a single host quickly and painlessly. It will also show examples of how to use MySQL Sandbox to solve practical administration tasks, such as re-playing binary logs or producing a filtered binlog.

SUMMARY:Ontological Conjunctive Query Answering over large, semi-structured knowledge bases 
DESCRIPTION: Ontological Conjunctive Query Answering knows today a renewed interest in knowledge systems that allow for expressive inferences. Most notably in the Semantic Web domain, this problem is known as Ontology-Based Data Access. The problem consists in, given a knowledge base with some factual knowledge (very often a relational database) and universal knowledge (ontology), to check if there is an answer to a conjunctive query in the knowledge base. This problem has been successfully studied in the past, however the emergence of large and semi-structured knowledge bases and the increasing interest on non-relational databases have slightly changed its nature. This presentation will highlight the following aspects. First, we introduce the problem and the manner we have chosen to address it. We then discuss how the size of the knowledge base impacts our approach. In a second time, we introduce the ALASKA platform, a framework for performing knowledge representation & reasoning operations over heterogeneously stored data. Finally we present preliminary results obtained by comparing efficiency of existing storage systems when storing knowledge bases of different sizes on disk and future implications.

SUMMARY:Submission Review with Open Build Service
DESCRIPTION: A reliable and transparent, high volume package review infrastructure was implemented with the [Open Build Service (OBS)](http://openbuildservice.org/). In OBS, a software package can travel through several projects. Submission Review is done at project specific gates to control such travel.The openSUSE:Factory project currently defines review gates for license compliance, security and packaging. Together with an issue tracking system we create a community friendly ecosystem that implements project policies. Centralized gatekeepers or dedicated review periods are eliminated. Propagation delay is minimized.With OBS providing the hooks to add review authorities, we were able to code most of the respective business logic with python scripts, reusing and extending the osc command line tool as a feature-rich layer ontop of the OBS API.This talk describes the openSUSE project review process and how it helps various stakeholders to excercise their control, using the legal team as a non-trivial example.

SUMMARY:PMH: Home Automation made right™
DESCRIPTION: PMH is a home automation system built from the ground up to be easy to use, modular and as open as possible. Our software and hardware are completely open source, with source code, schematics and CAD files available online. PMH consists of 3 layers. The hardware layer, the überdust layer and the apps.In the hardware layer, we use a wireless sensor network with sensor nodes and actuators that communicate with each other using the low-power IEEE 802.15.4 protocol and with a computer that acts as the main controller. The wireless sensor network consists mostly of Arduino nodes which control lighting, heating/air conditioning and electrical devices while at the same time using sensors to measure things like power consumption, temperature, light, movement, air quality etc.Überdust is responsible to bridge the other two layers by capturing and saving the data from the WSN to a central database, and provide easy to use interfaces (i.e. REST, Web Sockets) to the application layer. This way, applications can get sensor values from the wireless sensor nodes, and control the nodes accordingly.In the application layer, we have developed a web and smartphone application that gives users the ability to remotely control the system, view the current status of the various sensors and set automated behaviors such as turning on the lights when there are people in the room, sending a notification to the user's smartphone when someone enters your room, turning on the water boiler on predefined times, etc.Last but not least, due to the modular and open source nature of our system, its easy to add additional data providers in the hardware layer, such as an arduino with additional sensors, or even your computer and smartphone (i.e. your smartphone's accelerometer, the status of your server). It's just as easy to develop your own apps using our APIs, and extend the capabilities of the system to meet your own needs (remote controlled BBQ anyone?)

SUMMARY:Building app sandboxes on top of LXC and KVM with libvirt
DESCRIPTION: The libvirt library provides a hypervisor agnostic API for interacting with & managing virtualization hosts. Traditional uses of virtualization have focused on running entire operating systems in virtual machines or containers. The libvirt-sandbox library builds on libvirt, LXC & KVM, providing an API which facilitates the use of virtualization as a tool for building secure application sandboxes, without the additional burden of maintaining additional OS installations.

SUMMARY:You're doing it wrong!
DESCRIPTION: Based on his experiences with aggressively growing and maintaining the Exherbo community Bryan dives into the secrets and experience leading to this success.Exherbo averages 5 new contributors every month despite being a small and relatively unknown project. The contributors stay quite active within the project and stay with the project for years.Bryan drives straight into the heart of his community management techniques and explains how you can easily achieve a similar success for your project, be it open source or a otherwise peer driven project. He'll also turn it on it's head and explain how users can benefit from the exact same techniques to get faster and much better responses when dealing with developers. And how to get the upper hand when dealing with the system administrators at the office..Secrets revealed includes:* why you should only be looking for inexperienced developers* why you should openly apply social engineering techniques when dealing with developers* what makes inexperienced developers such a big asset for Exherbo* how users can manipulate developers into fixing their bugs and many more.

However, for that same reason, it will not get fixed. The new "POSIX::1003" (living on CPAN) tries to be an alternative: same functionality (and more), more consistent, and documented by function group.

DESCRIPTION: pkgin is aimed at being an /apt / yum/ like tool for managing pkgsrc binary packages. Many so-called GNU/Linux distributions provide a convenient way of searching, installing and upgrading software by using binary archives found on "repositories". NetBSD, and more widely, all operating systems relying on pkgsrc have tools like pkg_add and pkg_delete, but those are unable to correctly handle binary upgrades, and sometimes even installation itself.This is the purpose of /pkgin/, to provide the user a convenient way to handle binary packages, using the same working mechanisms than tools like /apt-get/.

SUMMARY:NoSQL/Graph Database Visualization, The case of Gephi and Neo4j 
DESCRIPTION: We are recently witnesses of the significant movement and adoption of NoSQL databases. In particular, the graph databases become an important technology as we deal with a high increase of relational data. They not only store graph data structures much more efficiently, but also provide powerful graph traversal capabilities that make them suitable for this kind of data. However we need to ease the exploration and understanding of these large amount of data. Visualizing the graph structure (relationships between nodes and edges) is critical to many situations like: verifying the reliability of new data input, optimizing an architecture based on the shape of the data, and even creating new services based on facts discovered in the data. In this talk, you will learn how to understand the graph structure easily using Gephi & Neo4j! We will go through the installation and showcase of visualization capabilities of Neo4j graph database in Gephi. The talk will cover exploration of general useful features of Gephi applying them on imported Neo4j database.

SUMMARY:Deploying Xen: troubleshooting surgery & discussion with Xen.org developers
DESCRIPTION: Recent developments in the Xen community mean that installing and configuring a Xen host has never been easier. However Xen remains both powerful and complex which can prevent a barrier to those wishing to deploy Xen.In this panel discussion we will briefly present recent user facing changes to the way in which Xen is deployed (e.g. xend to xl toolstack migration, Project Kronos, pvops Linux kernel domain 0 support).The bulk of the session will be an opportunity for users to describe problems which they are having deploying Xen and discuss the solution and possible future directions with a panel of Xen developers.

SUMMARY:Debian Secrets - what I wish I knew before joining Debian
DESCRIPTION: Debian is usually advertised as a volunteer project with a subtle mix of democracy and do-ocracy. While this is correct, implementation details are mostly undocumented, and it is often difficult for prospective or relatively new contributors to really understand the inner workings of the project.This talk will detail some useful lessons, and also some secrets about Debian learned over the years. It is hoped that it will be helpful to people willing to get things done in Debian.

SUMMARY:Challenges in the Design of a Graph Database Benchmark 
DESCRIPTION: Graph databases are one of the leading drivers in the emerging, highly heterogeneous landscape of database management systems for non-relational data management and processing. The recent interest and success of graph databases arises mainly from the growing interest in social media analysis and the exploration and mining of relationships in social media data. However, with a graph-based model as a very flexible underlying data model, a graph database can serve a large variety of scenarios from different domains such as travel planning, supply chain management and package routing.
