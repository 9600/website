<p>
  Starting in 2009, FOSDEM has hired professional guides each year to offer free
  guided tours of Brussels to the spouses/partners of FOSDEM visitors.
  If your partner would like to accompany you to Brussels but is not interested
  in the FOSDEM conference, this will make their stay worthwhile.
  Brussels has a rich historical past and a cosmopolitan present.
</p>

<p>
  The <em>free tours</em> will take place on both afternoons of the conference.
  Each tour will give you a view of a different part of the city, and the tours
  offered this year will be different from those offered in previous years.
  The guides will gather participants at a meeting point on the Solbosch campus
  (where exactly is yet to be announced), and every tour ends there as well.
</p>

<p>
  The tour on Saturday starts at 14:00 and ends at 18:30.
</p>

<p>
  The tour on Sunday starts at 12:15 and ends at 15:45, to make sure everyone is
  back on campus at 16:00.
</p>

<p>
  The guides are from the organization

(= &quot;Brussels inside out&quot;).

  Children are welcome to join, but bear in mind that these are walking tours,
  and that it is February.
  Your children must be old enough to walk around for three hours in winter
  temperatures (the responsibility is entirely yours).

<p>
  To make sure we know how many people to expect, please send an e-mail to
  tour@fosdem.org to register for these tours (you can join the tour on
  Saturday, Sunday or both).
</p>

<p>
  There is a maximum of 30 to 40 participants.
