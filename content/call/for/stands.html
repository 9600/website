<p>
We offer open source projects a place for <b>a stand</b> in the hallways. 
</p>
<p>
Stands can be used to share information, demo software, sell merchandising,
give away goodies and so forth. They allow projects to present themselves to
the visitors in a more personal fashion. 
</p>

<h3>What we offer:</h3>
<ul>
<li>one (max. two tables) of 1m80 x 80cm each, positioned in one of the three
buildings with devrooms,</li>
<li>during the whole two days of the conference,</li>
<li>two chairs per table,</li>
<li>one power socket type C/E (bring connectors/adapters, etc... yourself),</li>
<li>fast uplink shared wireless Internet access (a and b),</li>
</ul>

<h3>Further practical considerations:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The proposal should be about a free or open source software project and/or community,</li>
<li>There is no cost or fee involved when having a stand,</li>
<li>The stand should be manned by at least 2 persons during the duration of the conference.</li>
</ul>
