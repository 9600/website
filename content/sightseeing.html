<p>Starting in 2009, FOSDEM has hired professional guides each year to
offer free guided tours of Brussels to the spouses/partners of FOSDEM
visitors. If your partner would like to accompany you to Brussels but is
not interested in the FOSDEM conference, this will make their stay
worthwhile. Brussels has a rich historical past and a
cosmopolitan present.</p>

<p>The free tours will take place on both afternoons of the conference.
Each tour will give you a view of a different part of the city, and the
tours offered this year will be different from those offered in previous years.
The guides will gather participants at a meeting point on the Solbosch 
campus (where exactly is yet to be announced), and every tour ends there
as well. The tour on Saturday starts at 14:00 and ends at 18:30. The tour
on Sunday starts at 12:15 and ends at 15:45, to make sure everyone is
back on campus at 4pm. The guides are from the organization
Brukselbinnenstebuiten (= "Brussels inside out").</p>

<p>Children are welcome to join, but bear in mind that these are walking 
tours, and that it is February. Your children must be old enough to walk
around for three hours in winter temperatures (the responsibility is
entirely yours).</p>

<p>To make sure we know how many people to expect, please send an
e-mail to tour@fosdem.org to register for these tours (you can join the
tour on  Saturday, Sunday or both). There is a maximum of 30 to 40
participants.</p>

<p>The destinations of the sightseeing tours for FOSDEM 2013 are yet to be
announced.</p>

<p>To register, or if you have any questions about the sightseeing tours, 
please mail <a href="mailto:tour@fosdem.org">tour@fosdem.org</a>.</p>
