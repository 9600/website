<p>Uploading of our videos is almost ready!</p>
---MORE---
<p>There are four videos that aren't uploaded into our <a
href='http://video.fosdem.org/'>video repository</a> currently:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bill Hoffman's <a
href='/2013/schedule/event/open_science/'>Open Science, Open
Software, and Reproducible Code</a> talk; we mostly have the recordings,
but it will require quite some manual effort to get it finished, since
there were some technical issues during the talk, resulting in the
recording being a puzzle of overlapping fragments that we need to piece
together. This might take some time, and will need to wait until we find
the time to do it.</li>
<li>Zachary Powell's <a
href='/2013/schedule/event/linuxonandroid/'>LinuxonAndroid
and SlapOS on Android</a> talk in room H.1301 was properly recorded, but
due to a mistake on our end we have lost the recording. There is still a
slim chance we may recover a low-quality version of this talk, but it
may be irrevocably lost.</li>
<li>Similarly, we have also lost the recordings to Nikos Roussos' <a
href='/2013/schedule/event/fedora_rpm/'>The neat guide
to Fedora RPM Packaging</a> talk.</li>
<li>Finally, the <a
href='/2013/schedule/event/hardening_roundtable/'>Hardening
roundtable</a> headed by Francisco Blas Izquierdo Riera appears not to
have been recorded at all.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other than these four, all videos have been transcoded and uploaded.
You can watch the videos by going to <a
href='http://video.fosdem.org'>the video.fosdem.org archive</a>,
or&mdash;if
you have an HTML5-capable browser&mdash;to the individual pages in the
schedule where they will appear in a &lt;video&gt; element.</p>
<p>Apart from the videos recorded by the official FOSDEM team, there is
also one talk uploaded by the telephony devroom. Note that if you were a
devroom organizer and talks were recorded in your devroom in some
fashion (be that full video or just audio), the FOSDEM team would be
happy to host them on our server; just contact us via wouter@fosdem.org
to make that happen.</p>
