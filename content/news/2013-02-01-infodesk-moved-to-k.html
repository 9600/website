<p>
  For years, the main FOSDEM Infodesk has been at the entrance of the H
  building.
  This year, we've decided to move it to the K building.
  We hope this will allow us to somewhat reduce the bottleneck of visitors on
  Saturday morning.

<p>
  A small Infodesk presence will remain in the H building to help people find
  the information they are looking for.
