  We love the mobile schedule apps, and we would like to thank all
  the mobile app developers!
</p>
---MORE---
<p>
  You can find a list of apps we know about here:
  <a href="/schedule/mobile/">https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/mobile/</a>
  <br />
  Do you know about more apps? More platforms? Tell us about it!
</p>

<p>
  To thank the mobile app developers, and to stimulate the continued
  development of the apps, we are offering them a free FOSDEM t-shirt!
</p>

<p>
  Here is the deal:
  <ul>
    <li>
      The app must work with the 2013 schedule (preferably pre-loaded)
    </li>
    <li>
      Must be open-source, with browseable sources
    </li>
    <li>
      Simple forks don't count, ports to other platforms do if build scripts
      are available
    </li>
    <li>
      Only applicable to the developers that will be at FOSDEM in person
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  To get the t-shirt(s), the lead developer of the mobile app should contact
  us on <a href="mailto:info@fosdem.org">info@fosdem.org</a> with the list
  of developers that will be at FOSDEM and that have made a significant
  contribution to the project.
</p>

<p>

    Small print: we reserve the right to modify the conditions of the offer
    to avoid abuse or clear out ambiguities.
