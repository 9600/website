title: First video uploaded
---
<p>It's just two days after the event, and the first videos have already been
uploaded.</p>
---MORE---
<p>As there are plenty of talks which still require work before we'll be
able to upload them, you'll need to bear with us for a while. We will
make another announcement once all talks have been published.</p>
<p>To watch our videos, please go to <a
href='http://video.fosdem.org'>the FOSDEM video archive</a>. Please note
that synchronisation with our mirrors may take a while; this needs to
happen before you'll be able to see any video.</p>
