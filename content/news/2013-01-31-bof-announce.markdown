title: Community Meeting Rooms
---
Like last year, we will provide two 'community meeting rooms' (formerly called BoF rooms).

The concept is simple: any project/community can reserve a timeslot (15 minutes to an hour), during which they have the room just for them. 

It is meant for ad-hoc discussions, meet-ups or brainstorms. It is not a replacement for a devroom and it certainly is not meant for talks, so there will deliberately not be a projector. The rooms are cosy and small with around 30ish seats.


Reservation can only be done on site and *during FOSDEM*. The reservation sheets are at the infodesk in the H building. The rooms are not far from that infodesk. Reservations are on a first-come, first-serve basis.
