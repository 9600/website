<p>There are several kinds of activities going on at every edition of FOSDEM,
which are outlined here, with links to various bits of information about the
schedule.</p>
<p>FOSDEM is also a very busy conference,
<% if speakers.size > 100 and events.size > 100 %>
  with this edition sporting
  <%= speakers.size %> speakers, <%= events.size %> sessions,
  and <%= tracks.size %> tracks,
<% else %>
  with recent editions sporting
  400+ speakers, 400+ sessions and a wealth of tracks,
<% end %>
but we do our best to provide you with as much information and navigation
options about the schedule as we can.</p>

<p>Activities take place in all of
<a href="<%= pathof '/schedule/rooms/' %>"> the <%= rooms.size %> rooms</a>
that are spread across several buildings or clusters of rooms of
<a href="<%= pathof '/practical/transportation/' %>">the Campus Solbosch of the ULB (Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles)</a>
.<br/>
An <a href="<%= pathof '/schedule/roomtracks/' %>">overview of the room occupation by track</a>
is available, too.</p>

<p>There are essentially five different categories of sessions and activities
held at FOSDEM, which are detailed below: <a href="#keynotes">Keynotes</a>,
<a href="#maintracks">Main Tracks</a>, <a href="#devrooms">Developer Rooms</a>
(amongst which the somewhat special <a href="#distrominiconf">&quot;Distro Miniconf&quot;</a>),
<a href="#lightningtalks">Lightning Talks</a> and
<a href="#certification">Certification exams and related activities</a>.

<h3><a name="keynotes"></a>Keynotes</h3>
<p>As with almost every other conference, the FOSDEM Program Committee
invites a few speakers to talk about often slightly less technical but nevertheless
interesting topics around Free and Open Source software to get the audience
gently started into the day, as well as a closing keynote to help everyone
digest the vast amount of insightful information that has been collected
during the event.</p>
<% unless keynotes.empty? %>
<p>For this edition, the keynotes are as follows:</p>
<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
    <thead>
        <th>Title</th>
        <th>Speaker(s)</th>
        <th>Day</th>
        <th>When</th>
        <th>Room</th>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <% keynotes.each do |e| %>
        <tr>
          <td><%= l e %></td>
            <td><%=
                e[:speakers].map{|s| $item_by_id.fetch("/schedule/speaker/#{s}/")}.map do |s|

                            $item_by_id.fetch(s[:thumbnail].fetch(:identifier))
                          else
                            nil

                  text << l(s)

                end.join(", ")

    </tbody>

<% else %>
  <p><span class="label label-info">No keynotes have been confirmed yet at this point of time.</span></p>
<% end %>

<h3><a name="maintracks"></a>Main Tracks</h3>
<p>The <q>Main Tracks</q> consist of series of talks that are organized by topic,
where the FOSDEM Program Committee selects suggestions and actively invites
speakers on those topics.</p>
<% unless maintracks.empty? %>
<p>For this edition these are the main tracks:</p>
<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
    <thead>
        <th>Track</th>

            <% else %>

<p><span class="label label-info">No main tracks have been confirmed yet at this point of time.</span></p>
<% end %>

<h3><a name="distrominiconf"></a>Distribution Miniconf</h3>
<p>As the number of requests for <a href="#devrooms">developer rooms</a> grew and grew over the years,
with having only limited (albeit quite extensive) infrastructure to put at the disposal of open source
projects, combined with the fact that a significant fraction of those requests came from distribution
projects (Linux and *BSD distributions), we decided to start doing a &quot;conference in the conference&quot;
with several goals in mind:</p>
<ul>
    <li>avoid having almost all the developer rooms taken by distribution projects</li>
    <li>give a change for all distribution projects that want to take part into the conference to do so</li>
    <li>incite collaboration amongst such projects, as while do each do have
their specificities, they also do share a lot of tasks, goals, tools and
concepts (and, after all, fostering collaboration is the prime goal of
FOSDEM)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, in 2011, we started organising a <a href="#devrooms">developer room</a> on the topic of distributions, with
participants coming from many different such (open source) projects, and we dubbed it
<a href="<%= pathof '/distrominiconf/' %>">&quot;distro miniconf&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>As there are many participants and a wealth of interesting topics to talk about, present and share, the
<%= l '/distrominiconf/' %> takes place in two rooms across both days of the conference.</p>
<% unless distroevents.empty? %>
<p>The exact schedule of the <%= l '/distrominiconf/' %> currently sports <%= distroevents.size %> sessions
and <%= l '/schedule/track/crossdistribution/' %> can be seen here</a>.</p>
<% else %>
<p><span class="label label-info">No distribution miniconf sessions have been confirmed yet at this point of time.</span></p>
<% end %>

<h3><a name="devrooms"></a>Developer Rooms</h3>
<p>The vast majority of sessions (talks, hacking sessions, open discussions) are held in so-called <q>Developer Rooms</q>
(<q>devrooms</q>), which are organized and managed by Free and Open Source projects themselves, or even associations
between several such projects on a common topic in order to foster collaboration.</p>
<%
unless devrooms.empty?
columns = 3
%>
<p>Here is the list of the devrooms that are present at this edition of FOSDEM, in alphabetical order:</p>
<div class="container-fluid">
    <div class="row-fluid">
        <% (1..columns).map{|f| devrooms.select.with_index{|s,i| i % columns == f - 1}}.each do |list| %>
        <div class="span<%= 9 / columns %>">
            <ul>
                <% list.each do |t| %>
                <li><%= l t %></li>
                <% end %>
            </ul>
        </div>

    </div>
</div>
<% else %>
<p><span class="label label-info">No devrooms have been confirmed yet at this point of time.</span></p>
<% end %>

<h3><a name="lightningtalks"></a>Lightning Talks</h3>
<p>Lightning Talks are a very popular format that is used at many conferences, where speakers have a mere
15 minutes at their disposal to showcase a Free or Open Source project, an idea, or a concept thereof.</p>
<p>While that brief lapse of time may seem awkward, it almost always leads the presenters to concentrate
on the absolute essence and what is really important, which is why it is often a much appreciated approach,
along side with the variety of the topics.</p>
<% unless ltalks.empty? %>
<p>There are currently <a href="<%= lt_track.path %>"><%= ltalks.size %> lightning talks in the schedule</a>.</p>
<% else %>
<p><span class="label label-info">No lightning talks have been confirmed yet at this point of time.</span></p>
<% end %>

<h3><a name="certification"></a>Certification</h3>
<p>Several certification organizations provide FOSDEM visitors with the opportunity of taking certification
exams during the conference.</p>
<p><span class="label label-info">No certification exams have been confirmed at this point of time.</span></p>
