<% require 'time' %>
<p>There are several kinds of activities going on at every edition of FOSDEM,
which are outlined here, with links to various bits of information about the
schedule.</p>
<p>FOSDEM is also a very busy conference, with this edition sporting
<%= $item_by_id['/schedule/speakers/'][:speakers] %> speakers,
<%= $item_by_id['/schedule/events/'][:events] %> sessions,
and <%= $item_by_id['/schedule/tracks/'][:tracks] %> tracks, but
we do our best to provide you with as much information and navigation
options about the schedule as we can.</p>
<p>There are essentially five different categories of sessions and activities
held at FOSDEM, which are detailed below: <a href="#keynotes">Keynotes</a>,
<a href="#maintracks">Main Tracks</a>, <a href="#devrooms">Developer Rooms</a>,
<a href="#lightningtalks">Lightning Talks</a> and
<a href="#certification">Certification exams and related activities</a>.

<h3><a name="keynotes"></a>Keynotes</h3>
<p>As with almost every other conference, the FOSDEM Program Committee
invites a few speakers to talk about often slightly less technical but nevertheless
interesting topics around Free and Open Source software to get the audience
gently started into the day, as well as a closing keynote to help everyone
digest the vast amount of insightful information that has been collected
during the event.</p>
<% keynotes = @items.select{|i| i[:event_type] == 'keynote'}.sort_by{|i| i[:start]} %>
<% unless keynotes.empty? %>
<p>For this edition, the keynotes are as follows:</p>
<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
    <thead>
        <th>Title</th>
        <th>Speaker(s)</th>
        <th>Day</th>
        <th>When</th>
        <th>Room</th>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <% keynotes.each do |e| %>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="<%= e.path %>"><%= e[:title] %></a></td>
            <td><%= e[:speakers].map{|s| "<a href=\"#{s[:url]}\">#{s[:name]}</a>"}.join(", ") %></td>
            <td><a href="<%= e[:day_url] %>"><%= e[:day] %></a></td>
            <td><%= e[:start].strftime('%H:%M') %> - <%= e[:end].strftime('%H:%M') %></td>
            <td><a href="<%= e[:room_url] %>"><%= e[:room] %></a></td>
        </tr>
        <% end %>
    </tbody>
</table>
<% else %>
<p>No keynotes have been confirmed yet at this point of time.</p>
<% end %>

<h3><a name="maintracks"></a>Main Tracks</h3>
<p>The <q>Main Tracks</q> consist of series of talks that are organized by topic,
where the FOSDEM Program Committee selects suggestions and actively invites
speakers on those topics.</p>
<% maintracks = @items.select{|i| i[:kind] == 'track' and i[:track_type] == 'main'}.sort_by{|i| i[:rank]} %>
<% unless maintracks.empty? %>
<%
maintrack_days = begin
  h = {}
  maintracks.each do |t|
    t[:days].each do |d|
      h[d[:day]] = d
    end
  end
  h.values.sort_by{|d| d[:date]}
end
%>
<p>For this edition these are the main tracks:</p>
<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
    <thead>
        <th>Track</th>
        <% maintrack_days.each do |d| %>
        <th><%= d[:day] %></th>
        <% end %>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <% maintracks.each do |t| %>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="<%= t[:url] %>"><%= t[:name] %></a></td>
            <%
            maintrack_days.each do |d|
            track_day = t[:days].select{|x| x[:day] == d[:day]}.first
            %>
            <% if track_day.nil? %>
            <td>-</td>
            <% else %>
            <td><%= track_day[:rooms].map{|r| "<a href=\"#{r[:url]}\">#{r[:room]}</a> #{r[:start].strftime('%H:%M')}-#{r[:end].strftime('%H:%M')}"}.join(', ') %></td>
            <% end %>
            <% end %>
        </tr>
        <% end %>
    </tbody>
</table>
<% else %>
<p>No main tracks have been confirmed yet at this point of time.</p>
<% end %>

<h3><a name="devrooms"></a>Developer Rooms</h3>
<p>The vast majority of sessions (talks, hacking sessions, open discussions) are held in so-called <q>Developer Rooms</q>
(<q>devrooms</q>), which are organized and managed by Free and Open Source projects themselves, or even associations
between several such projects on a common topic in order to foster collaboration.</p>
<% devrooms = @items.select{|i| i[:kind] == 'track' and i[:track_type] == 'devroom'}.sort_by{|i| i[:name]} %>
<% unless devrooms.empty? %>
<% columns = 3 %>
<p>Here is the list of the devrooms that are present at this edition of FOSDEM, in alphabetical order:</p>
<div class="container-fluid">
    <div class="row-fluid">
        <% (1..columns).map{|f| devrooms.select.with_index{|s,i| i % columns == f - 1}}.each do |list| %>
        <div class="span<%= 9 / columns %>">
            <ul>
                <% list.each do |t| %>
                <li><a href="<%= t[:url] %>"><%= t[:name] %></a></li>
                <% end %>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <% end %>
    </div>
</div>
<% else %>
<p>No devrooms have been confirmed yet at this point of time.</p>
<% end %>

<h3><a name="lightningtalks"></a>Lightning Talks</h3>
<p>Lightning Talks are a very popular format that is used at many conferences, where speakers have a mere
15 minutes at their disposal to showcase a Free or Open Source project, an idea, or a concept thereof.</p>
<p>While that brief lapse of time may seem awkward, it almost always leads the presenters to concentrate
on the absolute essence and what is really important, which is why it is often a much appreciated approach,
along side with the variety of the topics.</p>
<% lt_track = @items.select{|i| i[:kind] == 'track' and i[:track_type] == 'lightningtalk'}.first %>
<% ltalks = @items.select{|i| i[:kind] == 'event' and i[:event_type] == 'lightningtalk'} %>
<% unless ltalks.empty? %>
<p>There are currently <a href="<%= lt_track[:url] %>"><%= ltalks.size %> lightning talks in the schedule</a>.</p>
<% else %>
<p>No lightning talks have been confirmed yet at this point of time.</p>
