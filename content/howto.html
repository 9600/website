<a name="intro"></a>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
  The new website uses a static content generator, which means that we have our
  content source (under <code class="dir">content/</code>) which can be HTML
  (<code class="ext">.html</code>), <a
  href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>
  (<code class="ext">.md</code> or <code class="ext">.markdown</code>) or
  sometimes files that only contain metadata that is processed
  (<code class="ext">.yaml</code>).
</p>

<p>
  First and foremost, the static content generation takes care of wrapping the
  individual content pages into a layout (see <code
  class="file">layout/main.html</code>: the
  content of each page is put in-place where the layout contains the markup
  <code class="markup">&lt;%= yield&gt;</code>).
</p>

<p>
  That means that each source file (under <code class="dir">content/</code>) may
  <strong>not</strong> contain the full HTML page markup, but is only a
  <strong>fragment</strong>.  To make it simple: just put the content in there,
  but no <code class="markup">&lt;html&gt;</code> or <code
  class="markup">&lt;body&gt;</code> tag.
  Note that the <strong>title heading</strong> of each page is also already set
  by the layout (as a <code class="markup">&lt;h1/&gt;</code>), so <strong>do
  not</strong> specify one in the content files.
</p>

<p>
  The generator also takes care of many other things, essentially the bells and
  whistles of putting the whole site together, with things such as breadcrumbs,
  page title heading, navigation, etc...
</p>

<p>
  The generator is similar to a compiler: whenever you make changes to the
  source (files under <code class="dir">content/</code>) and you want to see the
  result, you need to run the compiler (see <a href="#running-nanoc">running
  nanoc</a> below).
</p>

<a name="kerberos-access"></a>
<h1>Kerberos infrastructure</h1>
<p>
  We use Kerberos for authentication on our infrastructure.
  Before you can edit the website, you need to have a Kerberos principal,
  and you need to be given access to <code>git</code> and the website.
  Please <a href="mailto:server@fosdem.org">contact the server team</a>
  by email to get the relevant permissions.
</p>

<p>
  If you can access the FIT wiki, you already have a Kerberos principal.
  It will still need to be given access to <code>git</code> and the
  website, however.
</p>

<p>
  Before trying any <code>git clone</code>, <code>git pull</code>,
  <code>git push</code>, <code>git fetch</code>,
  <code>nanoc update</code> or <code>nanoc deploy</code> operation,
  you need to have a valid Kerberos ticket.
</p>

<pre>
% kinit philip@FOSDEM.ORG
philip@FOSDEM.ORG's Password: 
% klist
Credentials cache: API:501:3
        Principal: philip@FOSDEM.ORG

  Issued                Expires               Principal
Dec  7 11:26:00 2012    Dec  8 11:25:56 2012  krbtgt/FOSDEM.ORG@FOSDEM.ORG
</pre>

<p>
  If <code>kinit</code> fails, or you otherwise fail to get a valid
  Kerberos ticket, please <a href="mailto:server@fosdem.org">contact the
  server team</a> by email to help you debug.
  Or talk to <code>trouble</code> on IRC.
  All instructions below assume that you have a valid Kerberos ticket.
</p>

<p>
  In order to deploy the website, you should also make sure that your
  <code>ssh</code> client uses GSSAPI authentication when connecting to
  fosdem.org machines.
  Add the following to your <code class="file">~/.ssh/config</code> file.
</p>
<pre>
Host *.fosdem.org
GSSAPIAuthentication yes
#GSSAPIDelegateCredentials yes
PreferredAuthentications gssapi-with-mic
</pre>

<a name="nanoc.fosdem.org"></a>
<h2>Accounts on nanoc.fosdem.org</h2>
<p>
  These instructions assume that you want to work on one of your own machines.
  If you prefer not to install a whole Ruby/RVM toolchain on one of your
  own machines, we can give you an account on <code>nanoc.fosdem.org</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Note that even when using an account on <code>nanoc.fosdem.org</code>, you will have to install RVM and Nanoc as described in sections 1.2 and 1.3.
</p>
<p>
  In order to be able to access <code>git</code> and to push the website,
  you will need to make sure that your Kerberos ticket is <em>forwarded</em>
  when you log in.
</p>

<p>
  For your ticket to be forwardable, you need to obtain it with
  <code>kinit -f</code>.
  Alternatively, you can configure Kerberos to obtain forwardable tickets
  for FOSDEM.ORG all the time, with the following configuration in your
  <code class="file">/etc/krb5.conf</code> file:
</p>
<pre>
[realms]
    FOSDEM.ORG = {
        forwardable = yes
    }
</pre>

<p>
  You will also need to tell <code>ssh</code> that it needs to delegate
  the credential.
  Remove the comment in front of <code>GSSAPIDelegateCredentials yes</code>
  in the above <code class="file">~/.ssh/config</code> stanza.
</p>


<a name="git-clone"></a>
<h1>Checking out the website</h1>
<p>
  The sources of our website are kept under version control (namely, <a
  href="http://git-scm.com/"><code>git</code></a>).
  In order to make modifications, you first need to &quot;clone&quot; the
  repository to your workstation.
</p>

<p>
  Use <code>git</code> to clone the repository:
</p>
<pre>git clone git@git.fosdem.org:/srv/git/website.git</pre>

<p>
  Finally, go to the subdirectory <code class="dir">website/</code> that has
  just been created:
</p>
<pre>cd website</pre>


<a name="nanoc"></a>
<h1>Nanoc</h1>
<p>
  The tool we are using to compile the website is <a
  href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/">nanoc</a>.
</p>

<p>
  It is written in Ruby but that is of no concern except for installing the
  prerequisites as well as if you want to add or change to the scripting bits of
  our website.
</p>

<a name="install"></a>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
  The recommended way to install <code>nanoc</code> is to use <a
  href="http://rvm.io"><code>rvm</code></a>, which manages Ruby and Ruby module
  installations.
  The main advantage of using <code>rvm</code> is that it will take care of
  compiling the right Ruby version for you, as well as to install all the Ruby
  libraries (which are called <q>gems</q> in Ruby-speak) that are necessary for
  running <code>nanoc</code> and all the custom code that we've added to the
  website generation.
  And it will install and keep everything under your regular user's home
  directory (<code class="dir">~/.rvm/</code>) without the need to be
  <code>root</code> or break anything on your system which is probably still
  shipping an older version of Ruby itself and some of the requires libraries.
</p>

<a name="install-pre"></a>
<h3>Installing Prerequisites for RVM</h3>
<p>
  Note that <code>pngcrush</code> and <code>optipng</code> are not prerequisites
  for <code>rvm</code>, but are native applications that are needed for image
  size optimization when compiling the site.
</p>

<a name="install-deb"></a>
<h4>On Debian or Ubuntu</h4>
<p>
  Install the following development packages (as <code>root</code>):
</p>
<pre>
# apt-get install build-essential bzip2 libssl-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev \
libmagic-dev libmagickcore-dev libmagickwand-dev libpq-dev optipng pngcrush zlib1g-dev
</pre>

<h4>On openSUSE</h4>
<p>
  Install the following development packages (as <code>root</code>):
</p>
<pre>zypper install \
 bzip2 gcc libopenssl-devel postgresql-devel zlib-devel \
ml2-devel libxslt-devel ImageMagick-devel \
rush optipng</pre>

<h4>On MacOS X</h4>
<p>
  Use <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">homebrew</a> to install
  the following packages:
</p>
<pre>
  brew install imagemagick jpeg libmagic libpng optipng pngcrush
</pre>


<a name="install-rvm"></a>
<h3>Installing RVM</h3>
<p>
  Run the <code>rvm</code> installation using their script (make sure to have
  <code>curl</code> installed to do so) -- note that this must be done with
  your regular user, <strong>not</strong> as <code>root</code>:
</p>
<pre>curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby</pre>

<p>
  That will compile and install an up-to-date Ruby 1.9.x version under <code
  class="dir">~/.rvm/</code>.
</p>

<p>
  It will also add code to source the <code>rvm</code> shell wrapper functions
  to your <code class="file">~/.bashrc</code> and <code
  class="file">~/.zshrc</code> files.
  This will add <strong>measurable</strong> latency to every shell you start.
  It will also load a lot of Ruby-related code into your environment.
  If this is unacceptable to you, undo the damage in your shell startup files
  and use the provided <code class="file">setup-env.sh</code> script in the
  website tree.
</p>

<p>
  Once that has been done, to avoid logging out and in again, just do this:
</p>
<pre>
source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.rvm/bin"
</pre>

<a name="install-nanoc"></a>
<h3>Installing Nanoc</h3>
<p>
  Nanoc is simply installed as a bunch of Ruby gems, using <code>bundler</code>
  (for the Rubyists amongst you).
</p>

<p>
  After having <code>rvm</code> installed, run the following command, which will
  check which dependencies (Ruby gems) you are missing or are outdated, and
  install them accordingly. Please note that you need to run this within your
  clone of the website's repo.
</p>
<pre>cd $your_git_repo
bundle</pre>

<p>
  Note that the list of Ruby gems to install is in the file <code
  class="file">Gemfile</code>, with <code class="file">Gemfile.lock</code>
  holding the versions that we are currently using (to avoid getting some random
  version that might be incompatible or outdated).
</p>

<p>
  More details about <code>bundle</code> can be found here: <a
  href="http://gembundler.com/">gembundler.com</a>.
</p>


<a name="nanoc-update"></a>
<h2>Loading content from Pentabarf</h2>
<p>
  Before you can compile the website, you first need to load the content from
  Pentabarf.
  You don't need to do this every time, but it is a good idea to do so before
  pushing to the public website (q.v.) to ensure you don't push outdated
  information.
  You definitely need to do this before compiling the website for the first
  time.
</p>
<pre>nanoc update -y</pre>

<a name="nanoc-compile"></a>
<h2>Compiling the site</h2>
<p>
  To compile the site, run the following command:
</p>
<pre>nanoc compile</pre>

<p>
  or simply
</p>
<pre>nanoc</pre>

<p>
  (<code>compile</code> being the default command to <code>nanoc</code>).
</p>

<p>
  Once <code>nanoc</code> is finished compiling the sources (showing what has
  been modified or added or removed along the way, but not showing what remained
  unchanged, unless you also pass the option <code>--verbose</code>), you will
  find the resulting website under <code class="dir">output/</code>.
</p>

<a name="nanoc-view"></a>
<h2>Viewing the compiled site</h2>
<p>
  As the compiled site uses absolute paths everywhere (we could use relative
  paths, but that would slow down the rendering of the site) as well as
  assuming it's running under a web server that does directory indexing, it is
  not very practical to just open the resulting files with your favourite
  browser directly from the filesystem.
</p>

<p>
  Luckily, <code>nanoc</code> includes a tiny little webserver that runs on <a
  href="http://localhost:3000/"><code>localhost:3000</code></a> and does the
  above.
</p>

<p>
  In order to start that embedded web server, simply run the following command:
</p>
<pre>nanoc view</pre>

<p>
  Note that if you plan to make several changes, it is probably most comfortable
  to just run <code>nanoc view</code> in another terminal continuously.
</p>

<p>
  Now that <code>nanoc view</code> is running, just point your favourite browser
  to <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Note that there is no need to restart <code>nanoc view</code> when you perform
  changes or after running <code>nanoc compile</code>.
</p>

<p>
  To stop the web server, just kill <code>nanoc view</code> with
  <code>Control+C</code>.
</p>

<a name="nanoc-deploy"></a>
<h2>Deploying changes to fosdem.org</h2>
<p>
  Once you have made changes, ran <code class="cmd">nanoc compile</code>,
  reviewed the results in your browser (running <code class="cmd">nanoc
  view</code>), you should do two things:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>commit the changes to the sources to the git repository</li>
  <li>deploy the changes to the website to fosdem.org</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Nanoc also provides built-in deployment mechanisms, of which we are using
  <code>rsync</code> and, hence, you need to have <code>rsync</code> installed
  on your system.
</p>

<p>
  Note that there are two targets for deployment:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <code>staging</code>: will deploy to <a
    href="https://staging.fosdem.org/"><code class="host">
    staging.fosdem.org</code></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>public</code>: will deploy to <a href="http://fosdem.org/"><code
    class="host">fosdem.org</code></a>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Needless to say, be careful before deploying to <code>public</code>, as that
  is what all the visitors of our site will see <tt>:)</tt>.
</p>

<h3>Deploying to staging</h3>
<p>
  To deploy your changes to the website to <a
  href="https://staging.fosdem.org/"><code
  class="host">staging.fosdem.org</code></a>, run the following command:
</p>
<pre>nanoc deploy</pre>

<h3>Deploying to public</h3>
<p>
  In a similar fashion, to deploy the changes to our &quot;real&quot; website,
  do as follows:
</p>
<pre>nanoc deploy -t public</pre>
