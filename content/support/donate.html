<p>FOSDEM is an event organized for the community by the community. As such, we
think it is important to keep access to the event free.</p>

<p>The event is organized by volunteers who don't get paid and don't have
commercial interests in the event. As one might imagine, however, the
organization costs a lot of money and other resources.</p>

<p>The main characteristic of FOSDEM is that it is a non-commercial event. To keep
it that way, we think the best way to fund the event is to ask for support from
the open source community on a voluntary basis.</p>

<h2>Donors Return</h2>
<p>We're asking you to support the event by making a voluntary donation to make
FOSDEM happen.</p>

<p>Some gifts are given for donations depending on the amount of money, to each
donor:</p>
<ul>
    <li>€ 25 or more: a FOSDEM T-shirt! (different sizes available)</li>
    <li>€ 50 – € 99: a FOSDEM T-shirt + an O'Reilly pocket guide of your choice</li>
    <li>€ 100 or more: : a FOSDEM T-shirt + an O'Reilly book of your choice</li>
</ul>

<p>FOSDEM ASBL/VZW (the non-profit association) was founded in April 2002.<br/>  
Donations are not tax deductible.</p>
