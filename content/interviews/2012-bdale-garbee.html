<p><a href="speaker:2012/bdale_garbee">Bdale Garbee</a> will give a talk about <a href="event:2012/freedom_ootb">"Freedom, Out of the Box!"</a> at FOSDEM 2012.</p>
<p>Q: Could you briefly introduce yourself?</p>
<p>By day I'm the Chief Technologist for <a href="http://h71028.www7.hp.com/enterprise/cache/599999-0-0-0-121.html">Open Source &amp; Linux at HP</a>.  While I've worked on many different things over the years, in the Free Software world I'm probably best known for my long history of involvement in <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>.  I'm President of <a href="http://www.spi-inc.org/">Software in the Public Interest</a>, and on the boards of directors of the <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux Foundation</a> and the <a href="http://freedomboxfoundation.org/">FreedomBox Foundation</a>.  And I've been accused of having as my primary hobby turning all of my other <a href="http://www.gag.com/~bdale/">hobbies</a> into Free Software projects, from software defined radio to home-shop machining to high power model rockets!</p>
<p>Q: What will your talk be about, exactly?</p>
<p>A year ago, in his opening keynote at FOSDEM, Eben Moglen articulated the need for something he called a FreedomBox, and announced the formation of a non-profit organization to work on the idea.  I agreed to
join the board of the foundation and chair its technical advisory committee.  This talk will be a status report on what we've done together since then, and where we hope to go from here.</p>
<p>Q: What do you hope to accomplish by giving this talk? What do you expect?</p>
<p>As we work to turn visions into realities, there are many areas where we could use more help from the kinds of people who attend FOSDEM.</p>
<p>Q: What's exactly your task as the technical lead of the FreedomBox Foundation?</p>
<p>The original intent was that I would lead an advisory committee to help guide the activities of developers paid by the foundation.  Instead, I've done a mixture of direct technical work and cajoling others into helping solve specific problems that stood in the way of building FreedomBox as an almost-entirely volunteer project.</p>
<p>Q: What work has been done since Eben Moglen's talk about the FreedomBox in his FOSDEM 2011 keynote?</p>
<p>The foundation chose an initial hardware platform to develop a reference FreedomBox implementation, then we had to work very hard to resolve license compliance issues with firmware and drivers.  We've built a number of developer images, worked on a model of identity, put together key technical foundation elements, and as I write this are getting close to an initial "feature release" of software.</p>
<p>Q: Is the current FreedomBox code for the DreamPlug already usable? What other devices will be supported?</p>
<p>A DreamPlug can now be used as a stable Debian server, with almost all of the required firmware and driver content merged upstream.  We have released developer images for the DreamPlug, but nothing clearly
identifiable as a 'FreedomBox' yet.  Because everything we're doing is part of Debian, in theory any platform that can run Debian should be able to be a FreedomBox.</p>
<p>Q: When will the first FreedomBoxes be ready for use for the general public?</p>
<p>That's a good question, but one for which I don't have a good answer. Our initial feature releases should be sufficient for people familiar with Free Software to use productively, but a FreedomBox "appliance" for use by a broader audience will take longer.</p>
<p>Q: What can we expect from the FreedomBox project in the coming year?</p>
<p>That will be the main focus of my talk, and the answer depends a lot on who is willing to volunteer to help us.</p>
<p>Q: How big is the FreedomBox developer community?</p>
<p>The "core team" is quite small, and we are all volunteers.  There is a growing 'working group' community tackling various questions on behalf of the foundation, and it's not unreasonable to consider everyone who works on Debian and/or on key pieces of software that are important to FreedomBox as somehow part of our extended community.</p>
<p>Q: Which are the domains in which the FreedomBox project could use more contributions?</p>
<p>I will cover this in my talk, but I think the biggest need we have is for help designing and implementing a reasonable user interface / user experience layer to make the functionality that will be provided by FreedomBox useful to a broader audience than just Free Software enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Q: Have you enjoyed previous FOSDEM editions?</p>
<p>Absolutely!  I haven't made it to FOSDEM often, but when I do, it's a great experience.  The opportunity for face to face interaction with so many important contributors to the world of Free Software from Europe and beyond really broadens my perspective!</p>
