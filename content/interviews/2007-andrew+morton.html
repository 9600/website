Linux kernel 2.6 maintainer Andrew Morton shares some insights in this short interview in preparation to <a href="http://fosdem.org/2007/">FOSDEM 2007</a>.
</p>
<p>Q: 
What do want the audience to remember?
</p>
<p>
Help people understand what the kernel team are working on, how they do it,
what'll be happening over the next year.
</p>
<p>Q: 
Which tools do you use in a typical "kernel maintenance" day?
</p>
<p>
My crufty old patch-management scripts:<br><a href="http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/patch-scripts-0.20/">http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/patch-scripts-0.20/</a>.<br>
Extensively.
</p>
<p>Q: 
How has your experience been in the SCO v. IBM lawsuit?
</p>
<p>
I am serving as an expert witness for the IBM side.  I'm not supposed to tell you ;)
</p>
<p>Q: 
Oops.<br>
Last year, you warned about a possible decline in quality of the Linux kernel. What's your current opinion about this issue?
</p>
<p>
Basically unchanged.  I see a large number of bug reports go past, quite a
lot of them are recently-added bugs and I don't believe that we're putting
sufficient effort into resolving them.
</p>
<p>Q: 
What kind of test procedure happens before a stable kernel version is released?
</p>
<p>
Public testing: Linus's kernel is available on the kernel.org servers for about two months during the -rc phase of the release and thousands of people test it and report on any lems (we hope).
</p>
<p>Q: 
How do you see the Linux kernel evolve in the future?
</p>
<p>
Pretty much as it has over the past few years: steady, but rapid evolution.
</p>
<p>Q: 
What's the current state of the common parvirtualization interface that e.g. Xen depends on?
</p>
<p>
It's coming together.  I'd expect support for Xen's "Domain U" function to be merged in 2.6.21 or 2.6.22.
</p>
<p>Q: 
How is your contact with the different "commercial entities" that have an interest in the Linux kernel?
</p>
<p>
Pretty good, I think.  One of the reasons I retain a relationship with OSDL (Now the Linux Foundation) is that they facilitate contacts between myself and the industry.
</p>
<p>Q: 
Do you plan to work on something particular while at FOSDEM?
</p>
<p>
I'll only be in Brussels for a couple of days.
</p>
<p>Q: 
<a href="http://fosdem.org/2007/schedule/speakers/kristian+hoegsberg">Kristian HÃ¸gsberg</a> from Red Hat, who will also speak at FOSDEM, metioned that he is currently rewriting the FireWire stack. Do you agree that this is needed?
</p>
<p>
Firewire doesn't have a happy history - it's been fairly unreliable for quite some time.  But Stefan Richter has been doing a wonderful job of maintaining it in the past year and I think things are getting better there.
</p>
<p>Q: 
You can't blame us for trying, but... what is special about Google's Linux kernel version?
</p>
<p>
Nothing magical.  A lot of Google's machines run rather old kernels and the company is making an effort to update, and to stay closer to mainline.
