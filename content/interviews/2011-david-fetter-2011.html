<p>David Spetter will be speaking about PL/Parrot at FOSDEM 2011.</p>
<p>Q: Could you briefly introduce yourself?</p>
<p>I'm an employee of VMware and co-founder of PostgreSQL Experts, based
in the San Francisco Bay Area and have worked in various commercial
enterprises, non-profits and educational institutions.  I've used
PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL, Perl, PHP, PL/SQL, PL/PgSQL, PL/Perl and
(of course!) vim extensively in transaction processing and business
intelligence systems.</p>
<p>In my free time, I brew beer, ride my bicycle, and help run several
organizations for computer professionals including the Oakland Perl
Users' Group, the San Francisco PostgreSQL Users' Group and the San
Francisco Perl Users' Group.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the time I get to FOSDEM, I'll be married to a wonderful
woman named Sarah :)</p>
<p>Q: Congratulations.  What will you cover in your FOSDEM talk?</p>
<p>That would be telling. ;)</p>
<p>Q: Allright :-) Then what would be your goal for giving this talk?</p>
<p>I'd like to continue to stir interest in RDBMSs as programming
platforms, a side of them that is not emphasized enough.</p>
<p>Q: PL/Parrot is still in development.  For which kind of use cases
would you say it's ready today?</p>
<p>As with Parrot itself, this continues to evolve over time.  PL/Parrot
is now at a point where making domain-specific PLs is in reach.</p>
<p>Q: Having a full-blown virtual machine in the database is quite
empowering.  Do you expect PL/Parrot extensions to grow beyond only
triggers and stored procedures?</p>
<p>The major challenges to such growth are not technical.  Instead, they
lie in the agreements the PostgreSQL project and the Parrot project
can come to over licensing.  To become integral to the PostgreSQL
project, for example, by replacing the yacc grammar for SQL with
Parrot constructs, the aforementioned Parrot code would need to be
available to the PostgreSQL project under a permissive license such as
the 2-clause BSD or MIT.  To date, we have not started such
discussions.  That the Parrot project requires copyright assignment
makes such discussions realistic.</p>
<p>I do take issue with your characterization of triggers and stored
procedures as, "only."  In PostgreSQL, they are powerful and subtle
tools.</p>
<p>Q: Point taken.  Conceptually, how does PL/Parrot differ from PL/Perl?</p>
<p>PL/Parrot is a toolkit for creating interoperable languages.  While it
has its own language, PL/PIR, I don't expect anyone to use that by
itself to write functions, as it's roughly comparable to assembly
language.</p>
<p>Q: How do you see PL/Perl evolve in 2011?</p>
<p>I'd like to see some of the voodoo and magic in the implementation go
away.</p>
<p>Q: Are there any Perl (or Perl6) features that you find especially useful in programming triggers and stored procedures?</p>
<p>In PL/PerlU (no, that's not a typo), the killer feature is CPAN.  In PL/Perl6, probably grammars.</p>
<p>Q: You're a regular at FOSDEM.  How would you describe it in one sentence?</p>
<p>Biggest, best community FLOSS event in Europe, bar none!</p>
<p>Q: Thanks!</p>
