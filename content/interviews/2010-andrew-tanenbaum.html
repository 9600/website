<p><a href="http://fosdem.org/2010/schedule/speakers/andrew+tanenbaum">Andrew Tanenbaum</a> will give a talk about <a href="http://fosdem.org/2010/schedule/events/867">MINIX 3</a> at FOSDEM 2010.</p>
<p>Q: Could you briefly introduce yourself?</p>
<p>I'm Andy Tanenbaum. I am a professor of computer science at the <a href="http://www.vu.nl/en/">Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam</a>.</p>
<p>Q: What will your talk be about, exactly?</p>
<p>The talk will be an overview of the <a href="http://www.minix3.org/">MINIX 3</a> operating system, describing its goals, architecture, and implementation, with an emphasis on its reliability properties.</p>
<p>Q: What do you hope to accomplish by giving this talk? What do you expect?</p>
<p>I hope to generate more interest in MINIX 3 and perhaps pick up a few volunteers. I am also looking to hire a full-time (paid) programmer to work on the project.</p>
<p>Q: What's the history of the MINIX project? How did it evolve?</p>
<p>It started in 1987 as a way to teach UNIX after AT&amp;T forbid the teaching of V7 UNIX. Sine then it has become a vehicle for researching high reliability in operating systems. It is also a vehicle for seeing how well a multiserver operating system fits a multicore environment.</p>
<p>Q: The MINIX website mentions that the operating system targets embedded systems, high-reliability applications and low-power laptops. Can you give some real-world examples where MINIX is used in these domains?</p>
<p>One of the disadvantages of the BSD license is that nobody is required to tell us when they modify and use it so I don't know much about it. I believe it was used in one embedded system for managing commercial parking garages.</p>
<p>Q: How are the ports to PowerPC and ARM architectures going?</p>
<p>Poorly. The people doing both of them recently lost interest and gave up. If  anyone wants to pick these up that would be great.</p>
<p>Q: What are people using MINIX for?</p>
<p>I actually don't know. We are still developing it of course.</p>
<p>Q: How many developers are working on MINIX?</p>
<p>We have about a dozen people all in all at the VU, plus various volunteers in other places. It's hard to say. It's not a big group.</p>
<p>Q: What new features will we see in MINIX in the near future?</p>
<p>Live update is on the agenda and eventually kernel threads, which will open up porting all kinds of software, a new compiler, and eventually multicore.</p>
<p>Q: Have you enjoyed previous FOSDEM editions?</p>
<p>This is my first FOSDEM. I am looking forward to it.</p>
