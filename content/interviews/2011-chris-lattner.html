<p>Chris Lattner will give a talk about <em>"LLVM and Clang"</em> at FOSDEM 2011.</p>
<p>Because of his employer's policy, Chris couldn't be interviewed, but he agreed to share some information with us that we have posted below.

</p>
<p>Q: Information about the speaker</p>
<p>Chris is a software developer with a diverse range of interests and experiences, particularly in the area of compiler tool chains, operating systems, and graphics.  This is Chris' first appearance at FOSDEM, but he has enjoyed the work that has come out of the conference in the past, and looks forward to attending this year.</p>
<p>Chris started graduate studies at the University of Illinois in 2000 to do research work on compilers.  At Illinois, he started the <a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> project, which was open sourced and had its first release in 2003.  Chris graduated with a Ph.D. in 2005 and began work at Apple, Inc., where today he manages Apple's compiler team, and continues to work on LLVM.</p>
<p>Chris' work experience, before starting the LLVM project, involved working both independently and at a number of technology companies.  In that work he has written boot loaders, OS kernels, graphics drivers, and 3D engines.  He has experience with a number of large code bases, both proprietary and open source, including the Linux kernel, GCC, GDB, and the Java Hotspot JVM.</p>
<p>Q: Overview of the talk</p>
<p>The goal of the talk is to raise awareness of the LLVM Project and the capabilities it provides.  Of course another high-priority goal is to get a lot of people with new ideas together, discussing LLVM and meeting each other.</p>
<p>The talk will describe the greater LLVM Project and what it is all about.  LLVM is a widely misunderstood project: while many people see LLVM simply as an effort to replace <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a>, LLVM provides much broader capabilities than GCC in a far more reusable way.</p>
<p>It will give an overview of how the LLVM Project is constructed, describing how LLVM is actually an umbrella project, and lay out many of the components within LLVM.org.  For instance, the project encompasses a compiler optimizer and code generator (the "LLVM backend"), there are specific language front ends such as the <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a> frontend for C languages (C/C++/Objective-C) or <a href="http://vmkit.llvm.org/">VMKit</a> for Java frontends.  There are even non-compiler projects included in LLVM, such as the <a href="http://lldb.llvm.org/">LLDB debugger</a>.  The talk will explain how these projects relate, the common focus, and common technologies.</p>
<p>It will explain the comparison between LLVM and GCC.  For instance, the modular, umbrella-like nature of the LLVM Project is more accurately compared not just to GCC, but the complete GNU toolset, including GCC, GDB, binutils, libstdc++, and Kaffe VM projects.</p>
<p>A key goal for LLVM is building technology that is modular and reusable, in contrast to traditional compiler tools that are monolithic applications.  The talk will describe how LLVM's design meets this goal.  The talk will also mention several examples of LLVM usage, due in large part to the modular, library-based architecture.  Some of these examples can be found at <a href="http://llvm.org/Users.html">the project's website</a>.</p>
