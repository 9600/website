<p>Q: Your talk at FOSDEM 2008 will revolve around Unicode and internationalization support in PHP6. Why exactly is that?</p>
<p>I hope to convey how important it is to develop new sites and
applications with global audience in mind and how PHP can help with
this development. I expect only an open mind from the attendees.

<p>Q: PHP5 has a bit of a slow uptake problem: users are not switching to it fast enough. Do you think PHP6 could bring enough benefits to accelerate upgrades?</p>
<p>People switch to new versions when they feel that the benefits of the
upgrade overweigh the drawbacks of migration. PHP 6 is no different
in this matter. If people need good Unicode support, they will start
adopting PHP 6, so our goal is to educate people and make them aware
of what good Unicode support means for them.

<p>Q: You are involved in the development of PHP-GTK. What is the status of that project?</p>
<p>PHP-GTK 2 is very close to final release. It has been in beta for
some time, and so far there have not been any major problems with it.
I hope that we can make the release within a month or two. We also
now have a way to support new Gtk+ 2.x versions without much manual
work, so hopefully the future releases will be more frequent. There
are still some big and very cool pieces that we'd like to support,
like the ability to implement native widgets in PHP, support for Gnome
objects, and much more. These have to come after the version 2 release
though.

<a name="Do_you_feel_that_.27web_development_world.27_PHP_benefit_form_the_stuff_that.27s_happening_around_PHP-GTK.3F"></a>
<p>Q: Do you feel that 'web development world' PHP benefit form the stuff that's happening around PHP-GTK?</p>
<p>I believe so, and in fact it already has. When I started working on
PHP-GTK, PHP was at version 4, and I had to push its object-oriented
support to the limit, frequently running into problems with
implementation. I had long talks with Zend folks about how to rewrite
OO support in a better way and they did listen. So PHP 5 owes a lot
of its OO features (internal and external) to PHP-GTK, I'd like to
think.

<a name="So_do_you_think_PHP_will_become_a_popular_language_for_non-web_development_work.3F"></a>
<p>Q: So do you think PHP will become a popular language for non-web development work?</p>
<p>Yes, I hope so. I think it already made some progress. Look at PHP-GTK, for example - there are many professional applications written
in it, from point-of-sale systems to health records management. PHP
CLI (command line interface) is also gaining ground for scripts,
daemons, and other such applications. One problem though is that
because PHP was built around processing short-lived requests, there
are still issues with it running long-lived scripts, but hopefully
the new garbage collection will solve this issue completely.
</p>
<a name="In_which_direction_is_PHP_evolving_as_a_language.3F"></a>
<p>Q: In which direction is PHP evolving as a language?</p>
<p>PHP is always evolving towards what its users need it to be. It's
really a glue language, in a sense that it provides a language and
support structure for a bunch of technologies, from LDAP to Web
Services to database access. So when people ask, where will PHP be 3
years from now, it's a bit like asking, where will Web be 3 years
from now? I don't know, but I'm sure PHP is in the midst of it somewhere.

<a name="Do_you_have_any_comments_about_the_Open-Sourcing_of_the_Zend_Framework.3F"></a>
<p>Q: Do you have any comments about the Open-Sourcing of the Zend Framework?</p>
<p>Not much to say except that I think it's a good move.

<p>Q: Smarty, one of your other projects, is quite popular and is enjoyed by many PHP enthusiasts for its simplicity. However not all PHP coders know the benefits of a templating framework. What is, to you, the advantage that Smarty can deliver?</p>
<p>Smarty is a templating engine, not a framework per se, but it can
serve as a View part of an MVC framework (and I think it has
actually). Templating works well in larger teams, where people who
have to work on presentation layer (templates) are not necessarily
the same as the developers. The same can be done with straight PHP of
course, since PHP is a templating language, in a sense, but I think
Smarty (and other template engines) make it a bit easier for those
who are not developers.
