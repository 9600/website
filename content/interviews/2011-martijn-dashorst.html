<p>Martijn Dashorst will talk about <a href="http://wicket.apache.org/">Apache Wicket</a> on FOSDEM 2011 in the Web Frameworks Track.</p>
<p>Q: Please introduce yourself</p>
<p>
I'm Martijn Dashorst, author of Wicket in Action, committer for the
Apache Wicket project. I'm a happy, albeit sleep deprived, father of
Liam, currently 1.5 years old, and try to balance with my wife who
gets the most sleep at night. During office hours I work in the
historical center of Deventer for <em>Topicus</em> building Wicket-based web
applications.
</p>
<p>Q: What will your talk be about, exactly?</p>
<p>
I'll be speaking about Apache Wicket, a component oriented Java web
framework. The framework has been around since 2004, so it is not
exactly new, but it remains a hidden gem in the Java community. In the
talk I'll give a short introduction to the framework and its concepts
catering to those that haven't heard of Wicket or never took a closer
look at it. I'll also take a look at the future of the framework and
the upcoming 1.5 release (which should be interesting for current
Wicket users).
</p>
<p>Q: What do you hope people will take home from your talk?</p>
<p>
I hope that more people will take a closer look at Wicket and try it
out for themselves. I find working with Wicket enables me to get
better at OO programming and design.
</p>
<p>Q: Do you expect to meet many existing Wicket users or developers to be at FOSDEM?</p>
<p>
There are several companies that use Wicket in Belgium, Germany and
the Netherlands. I hope to see many come out of the closet :). As for
core committers, I think I'll be the only one attending, but I'll ask
around. Several committers are located in Germany and the Netherlands
so perhaps some will join me there.
</p>
<p>Q: What other frameworks and tools are often used together with Wicket?</p>
<p>
Spring, Guice, Hibernate, Maven, Eclipse, IntelliJ, Quartz, JQuery
(the wiquery project is pretty awesome).
</p>
<p>Q: Wicket attempts to separate logic and presentation (markup). Is
this a 'solved' problem now, or is it more of a continuous fight?</p>
<p>
When you use Wicket, it is a solved fight as we don't have any
scripting in our HTML templates. All view logic that acts on markup is
in Java code. This works quite well when you have a software
development process where you first create a HTML mockup and then
start slicing and dicing that mockup into pages and reusable
components —- a process that is used at my current company.
</p>
<p>
The fact that JSF now finally has support for HTML templates baked
into the standard (and not as an add-on library) is a boon to all
developers, and shows that Wicket took the right path in 2004.
</p>
<p>Q: What are the plans for Wicket going forward?</p>
<p>
[We'll] release Wicket 1.5 with revamped internals. Wicket's dependency on
inheritance has diminished, making it easier to combine frameworks
and libraries that build on top of Wicket. We will also continue to
make our API easier to understand for novices and experts. Igor
Vaynberg has proposed a Scala-like feature that explicitly marks a
parameter as optional.
</p>
<p>
We'll also expand our support for HTML 5 (the new markup). In Wicket
versions prior to Wicket 1.5 we validate markup for basic mistakes
(misspellings of attribute values for example) but that validation is
now becoming problematic when you want to use new HTML 5 constructs
such as email, URL and number fields. In 1.5 we provide basic support,
and with future versions we'll expand that support as the standard
matures.
</p>
<p>
Another item that is on our wishlist is to revamp our Ajax support and
client side story. Currently we use our own custom Ajax library, and
we already have a prototype replacement for our client side javascript
based on YUI3. In 1.6 we'll see where we can take this.
</p>
<p>Q: You've written a book about wicket (Wicket in Action, 2008).  How was this experience?
Can we expect more in the future?</p>
<p>
Writing a book is hard -— especially if you do it next to your day-to-day
job. There are 24 hours in a day, but you can only effectively use 8
or perhaps 6 hours of intense mental exercise. The rest is filled with
sleeping, eating and other things you need to do to stay clean, alive
and employed. I was lucky if I was able to get 1 hour of writing done,
completing 1-3 pages.
</p>
<p>
While I have pledged that I won't be writing a book anymore I do want
to be involved in a second edition, if that should happen. The current
edition of Wicket in Action still is relevant as we tried to provide
concrete examples and explain them on a conceptual level.
That said, Wicket has moved on since we wrote the book, and some API's
have changed. The concepts are still there and writing the <em>Hello World</em>
example hasn't changed that much.
</p>
<p>Q: How's the Java development experience these days on Mac OS X? Is it similar to other platforms?</p>
<p>
With regards to Wicket it is (as long as you instruct your scm client
and IDE to use the correct encoding). At my company we have developers
working with Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Linux (Ubuntu,
Fedora) and OS X on the same projects, without problems. The only
issues we run into are compiler incompatibilities between Eclipse and
javac in what is allowed with generics.
</p>
<p>
With Java in general, working on OS X used to be a challenge when
Apple didn't provide a Java 6. Soylatte was a nice way to be able to
keep on working. Fortunately those pioneering days are over and OS X
users can work again without feeling like a 2nd class citizen.
</p>
<p>Q: Sound like a nice way to work.  How is it like to work in the Wicket community?</p>
<p>
[It's] one of the most active, vibrant, helpful and friendly communities out
there. If there were awards for communities, Wicket's would be in the
top 10.
</p>
<p>Q: We hope FOSDEM 2011 makes into your conference top-10 too.  See you there!</p>
