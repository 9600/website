<p>
Kern Sibbald is the project founder and lead developer on the OpenSource <a href="http://www.bacula.org/">Bacula</a> network backup project.
</p>
<p>
He holds a PhD in Solid State Physics, but has always worked in the IT industry.  In the early eighties he co-founded Autodesk (the maker of AutoCAD). Since 1999 he has devoted full time to Open Source projects, first with <a href="http://www.apcupsd.org/">apcupsd (UPS management program)</a>, then with <a href="http://www.bacula.org/">Bacula (network backup)</a>.
</p>
<p>
His talk will present Bacula and the project around it.
</p>
<p>Q: What's the aim of your talk?</p>
<p>
Mostly, I hope to make more people aware of what Bacula is and what it can do.<br>
Secondary considerations are to attract new Bacula users and Bacula developers.<br>
Finally, since I have been working full time on Free/Open Source projects for the last 8 years, I would like to meet a few of the Bacula users as well as other Open Source programmers.
</p>
<p>Q: Have you attended previous FOSDEM editions?</p>
<p>No, this is my first Free/Open Source conference.</p>
<p>Q: Bacula uses a modified GPL v2 license. Which specific problems did the original GPL license expose?</p>
<p>The GPL did not really pose any specific problems. However, I have added four clauses that clarify certain points:<br>
1. to permit linking Bacula with Open Source programs such as OpenSSL that are not considered to be GPL compatible.<br>
2. A clarification of IP rights (i.e. despite our best effort we cannot guarantee that we do not violate any IP rights).<br>
3. Each contributor to Bacula certifies that he has the right to grant the license.<br>
4. For the Windows version, we use some Microsoft source code that is publicly available, but which we do not have the right to re-distribute except in our binaries (i.e. the user must get the source code for those particular parts him/herself).
</p>
<p>Q: How were the reactions of the community after the 2.0 release?</p>
<p>They have reacted very positively. Judging by the support requests, we have picked up a good number of new users, and I was also surprised at how many current users immediately upgraded.</p>
<p>Q: Bacula has become very popular in a short amount of time. Can you sketch the progress since the early days ?</p>
<p>Oh, to me, Bacula has been around a long time -- 7 years now, and it has been released to the public since April 2002.  However, what you say is true. Until recently, Bacula was adopted slowly.</p>
<p>Here are a few key dates:
</p>
<ul>
<li>January 2000 â€“ Project started</li>
<li>14 April 2002 â€“ First release to SourceForge (version 1.16)</li>
<li>29 June 2006 â€“ Release 1.38.11</li>
<li>January 2007 â€“ Release 2.0.0</li>
</ul>

<p>
Although these are not large figures compared to many Open Source projects, they seem to me rather substantial for a backup program.<br>
According to SourceForge statistics:

<p>I don't know exactly how they measure these statistics (I assume it is the total number of downloads), but I am impressed and pleased with Bacula's popularity compared to such a well know backup program as <a href="http://www.amanda.org/">Amanda</a>.<br>
There are other Open Source backup programs (<a href="http://backuppc.sourceforge.net/">BackupPC</a>, ...) which have much higher numbers but I don't think they compare in functionality to Bacula and Amanda.</p>
<p>Bacula's SourceForge page hits are increasing rather dramatically from year to year.</p>
<p>Q: What kind of "enterprise" features does Bacula have today, compared to commercial offerings ?</p>
<p>Quite a few.  A small list is:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Volume management</li>
<li>Pool management</li>
<li>Data migration (disk to tape, ...)</li>
<li>Data spooling</li>
<li>Encryption</li>
<li>Multiple simultaneous jobs</li>
<li>Data may span multiple volumes</li>
<li>Support for many OSes (Linux, Unix, OS X, Win32, ...)</li>
<li>Autochanger support</li>
<li>Support for most devices</li>
</ul>
<p>See: <a href="http://www.bacula.org/dev-manual/Current_State_Bacula.html">http://www.bacula.org/dev-manual/Current_State_Bacula.html</a> for more.</p>
<p>Q: Speaking of advanced features... Is a "snapshot filesystem" (like e.g. ZFS has) possibly a useful feature for backup systems like bacula?</p>
<p>Yes, we use Microsoft's Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS). On Unix/Linux systems snapshot filesystems are not in hot demand.</p>
<p>Q: What's your personal backup strategy like ?</p>
<ul>
<li>Backup everything on my server to tape every night (was DLT-8000, now LTO-2).</li>
<li>Backup the critical data on all my other machines nightly.</li>
<li>Full backup once a month.</li>
<li>Differential (all changed files since full) once a week.</li>
<li>Incremental every night.</li>
</ul>
<p>All backups go to the same tape that is retained at least one year.</p>
<p>For a site that I administer that uses disk based backups with 3 different pools, I use the following policy:<br>
Maintain 1 year of Full backups, 6 months of Differential backups, and 4 weeks of Incremental backups.<br>
This scheme is documented in one of the chapters of the manual.
</p>
<p>Q: Better be safe than sorry! Thanks for taking the time to answer our questions.</p>
