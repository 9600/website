<p>Spike Morelli will give a talk about <em>"I'm going M.A.D."</em> at FOSDEM 2011.</p>
<p>Q: Could you briefly introduce yourself?</p>
<p>I am a systems and software engineer, devops and data geek. I love visualization and infographics, we operate increasingly complex systems and the old way of looking at data is falling short. I like configuration
management, my developer self finds the infrastructure-as-code approach to be a blessing, and you need configuration management to make it possible. Monitoring is a necessity and a passion to which I've devoted a large chunk of my career, now mirrored by testing/test driven development/continuous integration efforts on my development time.</p>
<p>I have been working on a startup project since the end of last year and doing consulting on the side, mostly around the devops theme.</p>
<p>Q: What will your talk be about, exactly? What does the title "I'm Going M.A.D." mean?</p>
<p>I'd rather not expand the M.A.D. acronym and leave it as a surprise for the talk, but as a theme I'm going to focus on monitoring, metrics and software development. I'd like to share my experience going from a pure sysadmin role to a developer position and how those years in ops have influenced my choices on approaching software development.</p>
<p>Q: What do you hope to accomplish by giving this talk? What do you expect?</p>
<p>There are some techniques and approaches derived from my experience with monitoring applications in production that I'd love to see more widely adopted within the developers circle. I believe that as 
functional groups devs and ops have much to share with each other to the benefit of the individuals and the organization and I hope to be able to show some of that goodness in my talk.</p>
<p>Q: I read that you enjoy working on information visualization, especially in the context of dashboards showing system metrics. Which are your favourite free and open source visualization tools?</p>
<p>Unfortunately there are no good FLOSS dashboard tools, that's in part why I've been working on one, but right now I lack the time. On the other hand there are plenty great visualization tools. I think that most people would agree that server-side graphing is going away, a large share of monitoring softwares are pushing out new frontends shipping with JavaScript libraries to do the rendering client side. Therefore a lot of the tools I'm using are JavaScript libraries, with the most prominent ones being <a href="http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/">Protovis</a> and the <a href="http://thejit.org/">Javascript InfoViz Toolkit</a>. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flot/">Flot</a> is also a fairly common library, however in my opinion not as powerful. <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/">Raphael</a> is a gorgeous library with an incredible amount of functionalities and I'd use that if I had to do a lot of custom visualization, but its <a href="http://g.raphaeljs.com/">charts support</a> is not as nearly as good although promising. For charting only, the most advanced and beautiful library I've seen so far is <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/">Highcharts</a>. It's stunning, packed with features and free for non commercial use.</p>
<p>In the non-web world I have primarily used <a href="http://cairographics.org/">cairographics</a> and cairo based libraries like <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/">mathplotlib</a>. And if I needed something in 3D/opengl I used pygame (as you might have guessed I primarily develop in python).</p>
<p>There are many other interesting tools out there, but these are the ones I tend to go back to when I need to get stuff done.</p>
<p>Q: Have you enjoyed previous FOSDEM editions?</p>
<p>This is actually my first time attending FOSDEM. I am excited and grateful to be given the opportunity to speak this year. I look forward to bouncing ideas and drinking beer.</p>
