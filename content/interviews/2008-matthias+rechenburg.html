<a name="What.27s_your_personal_goal_for_your_FOSDEM_presentation.3F"></a>
<p>Q: What's your personal goal for your FOSDEM presentation?</p>
<p>My goal is to show how openQRM can help the IT-department
to manage their data-center especially when it comes to "mixed"
environments with physical and virtual systems. Since the openQRM platform
is implemented with a pluggable architecture I would also like to encourage
developers and system administrators to write new, custom plugins and to
see how easy it is to integrate third-party tools within openQRM.
</p>
<a name="What_is_the_link_between_QLusters_and_openQRM.3F"></a>
<p>Q: What is the link between QLusters and openQRM?</p>
<p>Qlusters is the sponsor and support company behind the
open-source project openQRM.
</p>
<a name="And_you_are_able_to_work_full-time_on_openQRM.3F"></a>
<p>Q: And you are able to work full-time on openQRM?</p>
<p>Yes indeed...
</p>
<a name="What_kind_of_functionality_can_openQRM_automate_for_such_virtual_systems.3F"></a>
<p>Q: What kind of functionality can openQRM automate for such virtual systems?</p>
<p>openQRM can automate the provisioning, deployment, administration,
monitoring, migration and high-availability for virtual machines in
the same way as for physical systems.
Via an generic partition-layer it conforms different virtualization
technologies and supports appliance-based, rapid deployment including
fast-cloning of servers using modern storage technologies.
</p>
<a name="So_openQRM_is_actually_used_a_lot_in_combination_with_virtual_systems.3F"></a>
<p>Q: So openQRM is actually used a lot in combination with virtual systems?</p>
<p>Yes it is, especially with Xen-based systems.
</p>
<a name="What_are_the_advantages_of_being_Open_Source_in_the_systems_management_software_market.3F"></a>
<p>Q: What are the advantages of being Open Source in the systems management software market?</p>
<p>The advantages for openQRM being open-source is that it raises the
acceptance and the number of potential users. We are trying to fill the gap for a
complete IT infrastructure framework which let system administrators
manage their data center using a single-management console.<br>
Of course it also helps to agree to certain data-center standards using
the feedback from the community.
</p>
<a name="Do_you_feel_that_openQRM_still_lacks_some_features.3F"></a>
<p>Q: Do you feel that openQRM still lacks some features?</p>
<p>Next to VMware, Xen, QEMU and Linux-VServer we (the openQRM-Team) would
like to add support for more virtualization technologies like
Virtualbox, openVZ and Virtuoso.<br>
This is definitely on the roadmap for the future versions.

</p>
<a name="Are_you_still_involved_in_OpenMosix_as_well.3F"></a>
<p>Q: Are you still involved in OpenMosix as well?</p>
<p>Yes, but since the openMosix project stopped its active developement
there is currently not very much to be involved with until someone picks
it up againÂ :-)
