<a name="Which_effect_do_you_hope_to_reach_with_your_audience.3F"></a>
<p>Q: Which effect do you hope to reach with your audience?</p>
<p>I hope to show how CakePHP can make application development easier and
more enjoyable. I would expect that attendees walk away with an
interest in understanding more about CakePHP and seriously consider
CakePHP as the framework for their next application.
</p>
<a name="Cake_sees_its_community_as_one_of_its_major_assets._In_what_ways_does_the_project_support_its_community_.3F"></a>
<p>Q: Cake sees its community as one of its major assets. In what ways does the project support its community ?</p>
<p>Since 2005 we have maintained free support channels through the
CakePHP google group and #cakephp irc channel. We have watched these
grow tremendously. In addition, we have over 3000 developers using
CakeForge to build their open source applications and share them with
the world. A little over a year ago we opened up the Bakery where the
community could share code and tutorials about CakePHP. The Bakery now
contains close to 500 articles all dedicated to helping the community
better understand and benefit from CakePHP. Finally, 2008 will bring
the first user conference for the CakePHP community.

<a name="Conferences..._We_like_that_:-.29__What_skills_should_an_ideal_Open_Source_project_leader_have.3F"></a>
<p>Q: Conferences... We like that :-)  What skills should an ideal Open Source project leader have?</p>
<p>A lot of patience. Dealing with personalities in an open source team
can be very different from work or family, as everyone contributes for
different reasons. To maintain a successful project, the leader must
balance the goals of the individual developer with the goals of the
project. Above all, logic and reason must prevail, and if those are
missing or clouded by ego or emotion, an open source leader does not
one make.
</p>
<a name="Do_you_see_other_PHP_frameworks_as_competing_for_mindshare.3F"></a>
<p>Q: Do you see other PHP frameworks as competing for mindshare?</p>
<p>Sure, and competition is a good thing. Competition makes everyone
better.  We all make choices everyday and choosing a framework is not
done without thought. We are very different beasts and have different
approaches to solving problems.
</p>
<a name="How_does_Cake_differ_from_Ruby_on_Rails_architecturally.3F"></a>
<p>Q: How does Cake differ from Ruby on Rails architecturally?</p>
<p>To do a complete comparison, you would have to look at the differences
between Ruby and PHP. However, CakePHP borrows many of the conventions
established by Rails. Since both frameworks rely heavily on these
conventions, you could say that architecturally the differences are
narrow. CakePHP breaks away from Rails when it comes to extending each
framework for the needs of a particular application.
</p>
<a name="Are_there_PHP5_features_that_you.27d_like_to_use_but_can.27t_due_to_PHP4_compatibility.3F"></a>
<p>Q: Are there PHP5 features that you'd like to use but can't due to PHP4 compatibility?</p>
<p>In some places we have made PHP5 functionality available to PHP4, like
__construct() and __call(). This makes the transition from PHP4 to
PHP5 seamless for developers. We are even providing an interface for
unicode support, so we can handle unicode now and be ready for PHP6
when it is released.
</p>
<a name="What_exactly_are_the_activities_of_the_Cake_Software_Foundation.3F"></a>
<p>Q: What exactly are the activities of the Cake Software Foundation?</p>
<p>Promote development related to CakePHP. The Foundation handles the
supporting websites, organizes CakeFest, maintains servers, and does
whatever it can to make CakePHP a great platform for developers.
