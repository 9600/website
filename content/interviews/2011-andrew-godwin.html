<p>Andrew Godwin will enlighten the FOSDEM 2011 audience about Django.</p>
<p>Q: Could you briefly introduce yourself?</p>
<p>Well, I've been writing open-source software for the last seven years
and Python for the last four or five of those; while you can usually
find me doing freelance web development, I'm currently working with a
mixture of both operations and web development for my new startup, <a href="http://www.ep.io/">ep.io</a>.</p>
<p>I tend to use Django in most of my work, but I do try and keep abreast
of other frameworks, especially where something a little less massive
than Django is required. I also enjoy playing around with new databases
and datastores, cheese, and mountains.</p>
<p>Q: What aspects of Django's architecture will you cover in your talk?</p>
<p>It's more of a broad overview; while the talk will be technical, I don't
expect that many people to be familiar with anything beyond the basic
layout of Django's internals. I want to address each of the major parts
of Django as a framework - the model layer, the templating layer, HTTP
and URL handling, and so on - and take a look at their individual
design, how other libraries and frameworks have done it better, how
Django chose surprisingly well, or (in many cases) how we adapted.</p>
<p>Q: What do you hope to accomplish by giving this talk ? What do you expect?</p>
<p>I'm not sure what I expect - introducing people to Django is always
nice, but a lot of people have heard of it these days. I'd say I see it
more as showing people the classic cases where things can go wrong in an
open-source project like this - some are web-specific, some are not.</p>
<p>Still, Django has a lot of history - almost 6 years, now - and in that
time we've managed to massively overhaul parts of the framework while
keeping backwards compatibility. There's lessons to be learnt about
being flexible, and adapting and fixing problems, but not rewriting
everything all at once. Django really is quite a nice framework, at the
end of the day, even after all the flaws I'll be discussing - a lot of
them are historical.</p>
<p>Q: Those flaws -- the 'bad/ugly' parts of Django's architecture -- do you consider those to be fixable?</p>
<p>Well, of the non-historical issues I'll be discussing, some of them can
be fixed relatively soon - in the next release or two, perhaps - while
others are perhaps more fundamental, and would have to accompany a
release with a significant drop in backwards-compatibility. We've not
really discussed if, or indeed when, such a release would happen.</p>
<p>Q: So there are already ideas brewing for Django post-v1.3?</p>
<p>Of course - there are too many! 1.3 was supposed to mostly be a
bug-fixing release, although several medium-size feature changes have
snuck in. There's a whole host of ideas for 1.4 and beyond - template
compiler improvements, adding some migration support into Django itself,
making the auth app more reusable, and others. We won't decide what goes
in the next release until 1.3 is released and everyone's had a bit of a
rest, however.</p>
<p>Q: Which properties of Python make it a nice language to write a framework in?</p>
<p>I'd say it's a combination of the huge number of libraries available
(there's at least one for everything), its relative ubiquity (I can't
think of a mainstream distribution of Linux that hasn't shipped with
Python in the last few years), and the relatively clean and consistent
code that gets produced - there's a pretty well-adopted core set of code
conventions (PEP8) that means nearly all Python code looks the same.</p>
<p>It's also quite an accessible language, which helps bring fresh talent
to the various Python communities. Still, there's definitely also the
fact that it's popular because... it's popular. Having a large community
to draw on for support and development resources seems to just drive the
language forward more and more.</p>
<p>Q: For some frameworks, it seems that the bigger they get, the more alternatives pop up for some of their subsystems.  Is this true for Django too?</p>
<p>I'd say it's not the framework getting bigger that's necessarily the
direct cause - as more people become familiar with a language, more
frameworks and libraries are going to spring up. It's definitely true
for Django, however - most of what's in the framework is also available
elsewhere as a separate library, or often as several competing libraries.</p>
<p>Still, I think this is a good thing. Competition, as well as new ideas
from those other alternatives, help us see what's popular and what
isn't. If we genuinely thought an external solution was better than our
subsystem (and that includes integrating with the other parts of Django
with only a reasonable amount of code), it'd be considered for inclusion
- after all, it's less code for us to maintain. That said, backwards
compatibility means such an inclusion is unlikely, except with new
features or parts.</p>
<p>Q: You work a lot on South (schema and database migration for Django). What makes migrations hard, and how does Django/South help?</p>
<p>Databases themselves are mostly what make migrations hard - they're not
particularly happy with changing their schema in the first place, and on
top of that, each database has a different syntax and different
restrictions (or, in the case of SQLite, an inability to do basically
anything other than add columns). The hardest part of South is
maintaining those abstractions to the different databases.</p>
<p>There's also the element of organisation that South solves for you, by
tracking what's applied. That's not necessarily as difficult for the
developer to do, but it's tedious, and a small mistake can result in the
database schema being changed in unintended ways. I wanted to remove
that element of risk, and apparently a lot of other people agree with me.</p>
<p>Q: How would you describe the Django community?</p>
<p>It's fantastic. We have a great core team, and a good community of
people around that, not only contributing patches and reporting bugs,
but also helping by writing documentation, running conferences,
supporting other users, giving us constructive criticism, promoting
Django, or just writing great sites using it. It's everything I could
ask for from an open-source community.</p>
<p>Q: Nice to hear.  You're also working on a hosting service for Python apps (<a href="http://www.ep.io/">ep.io</a>).  Is it any different to develop for a hosting platform versus standard web/framework programming?</p>
<p>It depends if you're talking about developing applications to run on the
hosting platform, or developing the hosting platform itself. Developing
applications to run on ep.io is almost identical to normal web
development - that's one of the design goals, and there's only a few
small restrictions to keep things portable. Some other hosting platforms
require significant changes to your code to get it to run, but it's
usually to make it easier for them to scale your app; we went for the
route that gives us the hard work, not the users.</p>
<p>Developing the platform itself, on the other hand, has been very
interesting, mostly since I finally get to use a whole heap of core
Linux functionality and system calls that have no use in normal
programs, as well as the inherent difficulty in testing and optimising a
distributed, self-healing system. I consider this fun; other people
probably have a different opinion.</p>
<p>Q: OK, thanks!</p>
