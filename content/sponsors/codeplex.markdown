CodePlex is Microsoft's open source project hosting web site.

Open source developers can use CodePlex.com to create new projects to share
with the world, join others who have already started their own projects, or use
the applications on the site and provide feedback.

CodePlex.com was designed as a place where developers could build open source
projects using Microsoft tools and technologies. Microsoft began to host
CodePlex.com to address customer requests for more transparency, code sharing
and participation in open source development from Microsoft.

CodePlex.com now hosts over 17,000 projects, with more than 400 from Microsoft.
Microsoft does not control, review, revise, endorse or distribute the third
party projects on this site. Microsoft is hosting the CodePlex.com site solely
as a web storage site as a service to the
developer community.

For more information, please go to [codeplex.com](http://www.codeplex.com/) or
[microsoft.com](http://www.microsoft.com/opensource).

Codeplex supports the event financially.
