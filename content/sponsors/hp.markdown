As the world’s largest IT company, HP focuses on simplifying technology
experiences for all its customers – from individual consumers to large
enterprises.

HP helps businesses focus on innovation instead of IT operations by offering
robust solutions based on HP inventions, open source software, and
industry-standard hardware in a converged infrastructure. In fact, as the
leading provider of scalable Linux platforms, HP ships one Linux server every
minute.

HP not only uses open source within the company extensively but also
contributes our expertise to hundreds of open source projects worldwide. In
fact, we built tools for open source governance in enterprises, then released
them as an open source project called FOSSology. Also, HP helps lead the
thriving FOSSBazaar community focused on free and open source governance best
practices, education, and tools.
