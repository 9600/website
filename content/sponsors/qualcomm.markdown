A heritage of innovation...

Launched in 1985, a small company focused on "QUALity COMMunications" evolved
into one of the telecommunications industry's greatest success stories. In
1989, Qualcomm demonstrated CDMA, a technology that changed wireless
communications forever.

Qualcomm's support of the Eudora email program was an early demonstration of
its commitment to open source software. In addition advances in CDMA and
complementary technologies earned Qualcomm distinction as the world leader in
3G and 4G mobile broadband. Its ever-growing investment in R&D continues to
drive the industry with new mobile breakthroughs.

Today, Qualcomm innovation is redefining mobility and empowering people to
transform the way they live, learn, work and play.

Qualcomm supports the event financially.
