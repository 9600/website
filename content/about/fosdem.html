<a name="what-is-fosdem"><h1>What is FOSDEM</h1></a>
<p>FOSDEM is a free and non-commercial event organized by the community for the
community. The goal is to provide Free Software and Open Source developers and
communities a place to meet to:</p>

<ul>
<li>get in touch with other developers and projects;</li>
<li>be informed about the latest developments in the Free Software and Open Source world;</li>
<li>attend interesting talks and presentations held in large conference rooms
by Free Software and Open Source project leaders and committers on various
topics; and</li>
<li>to promote the development and the benefits of Free Software and Open
Source solutions.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Participation and attendance is totally free, though the organization
gratefully accepts donationals and sponsorships.
</p>

<a name="devrooms"><h1>Developer Rooms</h1></a>
<p>
The FOSDEM team thinks it is very important for Free Software and Open Source
developers around the world to be able to meet in "real life". To this end, we
have set up Developer Rooms (DevRooms) with network/internet connectivity and
projectors where development teams can meet and showcase their projects.
DevRooms are a place for teams to discuss, hack and publicly present latest
directions, lightning talks, news and discussions.
</p>

<p>We believe developers can benefit a lot from these meetings.</p>

<p>Last year, there were more than 160 talks in the Developer Rooms in addition
to the many main-track talks, the lightning talks and the LPI exams and the
PGP/CAcert keysigning events.</p>

<a name="history"><h1>Some history...</h1></a>
<p>In 2000, Raphael Bauduin, a fan of the Linux movement in Belgium, decided to
organize a small meeting for developers of Open Source software. He called it:
Open Source Developers' European Meeting (OSDEM).</p>

<p>Raph created a mailing list, a small website and spread the word to people
around him.  Only a few weeks later, lots of people were waiting for an
exciting event in Brussels!</p>

<p>Invitations were sent to well-known figures in the community: Rasterman,
Fyodor, Jeremy Allison and so on. They all gave a very positive response and
the OSDEM was on the road to success.</p>

<p>Many years later, OSDEM has grown to the event we now know as FOSDEM.</p>

<p>We now try to cover a wide spectrum of Open Source and Free Software
projects, and offer a platform for people to collaborate in the true Open
Source spirit.  Every year, usually during the last weekend of February, we
host around 4000 visitors at the ULB Solbosh campus.</p>

<p>Raphael is no longer the only one behind FOSDEM, after 7 years of hard work he left the team for new Open Source plans.
 A list of the entire staff can be seen <a href="#team">here</a>, together with
 some information on their involvement in the FOSDEM conference.</p>
