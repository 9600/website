            <li>get in touch with other developers and projects;</li>
            <li>be informed about the latest developments in the Free Software and Open Source world;</li>
            <li>attend interesting talks and presentations on various topics by Free Software and Open Source project leaders and committers;</li>
            <li>to promote the development and the benefits of Free Software and Open Source solutions.</li>

        <h2>Developer Rooms</h2>
        <p>The FOSDEM team thinks it is very important for Free Software and Open Source developers around the world to be able to meet in “real life”.</p>
        <p>To this end, we have set up Developer Rooms (DevRooms) with network/internet connectivity and projectors where development teams can meet and showcase their projects. DevRooms are a place for teams to discuss, hack and publicly present latest directions, lightning talks, news and discussions.</p>
        <p>We believe developers can benefit a lot from these meetings.</p>
        <p>Last year, there were more than 160 talks in the Developer Rooms in addition to the many main-track talks, the lightning talks, the LPI exams and the PGP/CAcert keysigning events.</p>

        <h2>A Bit of History</h2>
        <p>In 2000, Raphael Bauduin, a fan of the Linux movement in Belgium, decided to
        organize a small meeting for developers of Open Source software. He called it:
        Open Source Developers' European Meeting (OSDEM).</p>

        <p>Raphael created a mailing list, a small website and spread the word to people
        around him. Only a few weeks later, lots of people were waiting for an
        exciting event in Brussels!</p>

        <p>Invitations were sent to well-known figures in the community: Rasterman,
        Fyodor, Jeremy Allison and so on. They all gave a very positive response and
        OSDEM was on the road to success.</p>

        <p> For the second year, OSDEM was renamed FOSDEM. And now, many years later, it
        has grown into the event it is today.</p>

        <p>We now try to cover a wide spectrum of Open Source and Free Software
        projects, and offer a platform for people to collaborate in the true Open
        Source spirit.  Every year, usually during the last weekend of February, we
        host around 5000 visitors at the ULB Solbosh campus.</p>

        <p>Raphael is no longer the only one driving FOSDEM. After 7 years of hard work
        he left the team for new Open Source plans. The FOSDEM flag is now proudly carried
        by the following people:</p>
