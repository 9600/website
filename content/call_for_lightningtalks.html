<p>
<b>Lightning Talks</b> are your chance for 15 minutes of fame: every free or
open source project can apply for giving a lightning talk at FOSDEM. 
</p>
<p>
Our goal is to offer all the projects that do not fit in a specific main track
or devroom the opportunity to speak. During exactly 15 minutes, one person gets
to present the project or any aspect of it. All the lightning talks happen in a
large room that can host up to 300 people.
