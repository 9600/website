    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
    The new website uses a static content generator, which means that we have
    our content source (under <code class="dir">content/</code>) which can be HTML
    (<code class="ext">.html</code>), <a
      href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>
    (<code class="ext">.md</code> or <code class="ext">.markdown</code>) or
    sometimes files that only contain metadata that is processed
    (<code class="ext">.yaml</code>).
    </p>
    <p>
    First and foremost, the static content generation takes care of wrapping the
    individual content pages into a layout (see <code class="file">layout/main.html</code>: the
    content of each page is put in-place where the layout contains the markup
    <code class="markup">&lt%= yield&gt;</code>).
    </p>
    <p>
    That means that each source file (under <code class="dir">content/</code>) may
    <strong>not</strong> contain the full HTML page markup, but is only a <strong>fragment</strong>.
    To make it simple: just put the content in there, but no <code class="markup">&lt;html&gt;</code>
    or <code class="markup">&lt;body&gt;</code> tag.
    Note that the <strong>title heading</strong> of each page is also already set by
    the layout (as a <code class="markup">&lt;h1/&gt;</code>), so <strong>do not</strong>
    specify one in the content files.
    </p>
    <p>
    The generator also takes care of many other things, essentially the bells and whistles
    of putting the whole site together, with things such as breadcrumbs, page title heading,
    navigation, etc...
    </p>
    <p>
    The generator is similar to a compiler: whenever you make changes to the source
    (files under <code class="dir">content/</code>) and you want to see the result, you
    need to run the compiler (see <a href="#running-nanoc">running nanoc</a> below).
    </p>

    <a name="nanoc"></a>
    <h1>Nanoc</h1>
    <p>
    The tool we are using to compile the website is <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/">nanoc</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    It is written in Ruby but that is of no concern except for installing the prerequisites
    as well as if you want to add or change to the scripting bits of our website.
    </p>

    <a name="install"></a>
    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>
    The recommended way to install <code>nanoc</code> is to use <a href="http://rvm.io"><code>rvm</code></a>,
    which manages Ruby and Ruby module installations. The main advantage of using <code>rvm</code> is that
    it will take care of compiling the right Ruby version for you, as well as to install all the Ruby
    libraries (which are called <q>gems</q> in Ruby-speak) that are necessary for running <code>nanoc</code>
    and all the custom code that we've added to the website generation. And it will install and keep everything
    under your regular user's home directory (<code class="dir">~/.rvm/</code>) without the need to be
    <code>root</code> or break anything on your system which is probably still shipping an older version
    of Ruby itself and some of the requires libraries.
    </p>

    <a name="install-pre"></a>
    <h3>Installing Prerequisites for RVM</h3>
    <p>
    Note that <code>pngcrush</code> and <code>optipng</code> are not prerequisites for <code>rvm</code>,
    but are native applications that are needed for image size optimization when compiling the site.
    </p>
    <a name="install-deb"></a>
    <h4>On Debian or Ubuntu</h4>
    <p>
    Install the following development packages (as <code>root</code>):
    </p>
    <pre>apt-get install \
make bzip2 gcc libssl-dev libpq-dev libz-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev \
libmagic-dev libmagick++-dev libmagickcore-dev libmagickwand-dev \
pngcrush optipng</pre>
    <h4>On openSUSE</h4>
    <p>
    Install the following development packages (as <code>root</code>):
    </p>
    <pre>zypper install \
make bzip2 gcc libopenssl-devel postgresql-devel zlib-devel \
libxml2-devel libxslt-devel ImageMagick-devel \
pngcrush optipng</pre>

    <a name="git-clone"></a>
    <h3>Checking out the website</h3>
    <p>
    The sources of our website are kept under version control (namely, <a href="http://git-scm.com/"><code>git</code></a>).
    In order to make modifications, you first need to &quot;clone&quot; the repository to your workstation.
    </p>
    <p>
    To do so, you need to have access to <code class="host">git.fosdem.org</code> using <code>ssh</code>
    (if not, please <a href="mailto:server@fosdem.org?subject=Account on apeiron">contact our
      server team by email</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
    To clone the sources initially, create a working directory on your local system, e.g.:
    </p>
    <pre>mkdir -p ~/src/projects/fosdem</pre>
    <p>
    Then change to that directory using
    </p>
    <pre>cd ~/src/projects/fosdem</pre>
    <p>
    Now use <code>git</code> to clone the repository:
    </p>
    <pre>git clone YOUR_USERNAME_ON_GIT@git.fosdem.org:/srv/git/website.git</pre>
    <p>Obviously, replace <code>YOUR_USERNAME_ON_GIT</code> with your username on
    <code class="host">git.fosdem.org</code>.</p>
    <p>
    Finally, go to the subdirectory <code class="dir">website/</code> that has just
    been created:
    </p>
    <pre>cd website</pre>

    <a name="install-rvm"></a>
    <h3>Installing RVM</h3>
    <p>
    Run the <code>rvm</code> installation using their script (make sure
    to have <code>curl</code> installed to do so) -- note that this
    must be done with your regular user, <strong>not</strong> as
    <code>root</code>:
    </p>
    <pre>curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby</pre>
    <p>
    That will compile and install an up-to-date Ruby 1.9.x version as
    well as add the sourcing of the <code>rvm</code> shell wrapper
    functions in your <code class="file">~/.bashrc</code>, all
    under <code class="dir">~/.rvm/</code> (it will <strong>not</strong>
    touch anything else on your system).
    </p>
    <p>
    Once that has been done, to avoid logging out and in again, just do this:
    </p>
    <pre>source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.rvm/bin"</pre>

    <a name="install-nanoc"></a>
    <h3>Installing Nanoc</h3>
    <p>
    Nanoc is simply installed as a bunch of Ruby gems, using <code>bundler</code>
    (for the Rubyists amongst you).
    </p>
    <p>
    After having <code>rvm</code> installed, run the following command, which will
    check which dependencies (Ruby gems) you are missing or are outdated, and install
    them accordingly:
    </p>
    <pre>bundle</pre>
    <p>Note that the list of Ruby gems to install is in the file <code class="file">Gemfile</code>,
    with <code class="file">Gemfile.lock</code> holding the versions that we are currently
    using (to avoid getting some random version that might be incompatible or outdated).</p>
    <p>
    More details about <code>bundle</code> can be found here:
    <a href="http://gembundler.com/">gembundler.com</a>.
    </p>

    <a name="nanoc-compile"></a>
    <h3>Compiling the site</h3>
    <p>
    To compile the site, run the following command:
    </p>
    <pre>nanoc compile</pre>
    <p>or simply</p>
    <pre>nanoc</pre>
    <p>(<code>compile</code> being the default command to <code>nanoc</code>).</p>
    <p>
    Once <code>nanoc</code> is finished compiling the sources (showing what has been
    modified or added or removed along the way, but not showing what remained
    unchanged, unless you also pass the option <code>--verbose</code>), you will
    find the resulting website under <code class="dir">output/</code>.
    </p>
    <a name="nanoc-view"></a>
    <h3>Viewing the compiled site</h3>
    <p>
    As the compiled site uses absolute paths everywhere (we could use relative paths,
    but that would slow down the rendering of the site) as well as assuming it's
    running under a web server that does directory indexing, it is not very
    practical to just open the resulting files with your favourite browser directly
    from the filesystem.
    </p>
    <p>
    Luckily, <code>nanoc</code> includes a tiny little webserver that runs on
    <a href="http://localhost:3000/"><code>localhost:3000</code></a> and does the above.
    </p>
    <p>
    In order to start that embedded web server, simply run the following command:
    </p>
    <pre>nanoc view</pre>
    <p>
    Note that if you plan to make several changes, it is probably most comfortable to
    just run <code>nanoc view</code> in another terminal continuously.
    </p>
    <p>
    Now that <code>nanoc view</code> is running, just point your favourite browser
    to <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Note that there is no need to restart <code>nanoc view</code> when you perform
    changes or after running <code>nanoc compile</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
    To stop the web server, just kill <code>nanoc view</code> with <code>Control+C</code>.
    </p>
    <a name="nanoc-deploy"></a>
    <h3>Deploying changes to fosdem.org</h3>
    <p>
    Once you have made changes, ran <code class="cmd">nanoc compile</code>, reviewed
    the results in your browser (running <code class="cmd">nanoc view</code>), you should
    do two things:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>commit the changes to the sources to the git repository</li>
      <li>deploy the changes to the website to fosdem.org</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Nanoc also provides built-in deployment mechanisms, of which we are using <code>rsync</code>
    and, hence, you need to have <code>rsync</code> installed on your system.
    </p>
    <p>
    You will also need to have an account on <code class="host">apeiron.fosdem.org</code>
    and the ability of <code>ssh</code>-ing into <code class="host">apeiron.fosdem.org</code>
    (if not, please <a href="mailto:server@fosdem.org?subject=Account on apeiron">contact our
      server team by email</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
    You will most probably want to also configure your username on <code class="host">apeiron</code>
    in your <code class="file">~/.ssh/config</code>, as the configuration of the Nanoc deployment
    simply uses <code>apeiron.fosdem.org</code> as the remote host for <code>rsync</code> and, unless
    your local username is the same as your username on <code>apeiron</code>, you need to configure
    <code>ssh</code> to use another username.
    </p>
    <p>
    For that, add the following lines to your <code class="file">~/.ssh/config</code> (or create
    that file if it does not exist yet):
    </p>
    <pre class="content">Host apeiron.fosdem.org
    User=MY_USERNAME_ON_APEIRON
    GSSAPIAuthentication yes
    GSSAPIDelegateCredentials yes</pre>
    <p>
    Obviously, replace <code>MY_USERNAME_ON_APEIRON</code> accordingly, e.g. with <code>jdoe</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Test your remote access first, using the following command:
    </p>
    <pre>ssh apeiron.fosdem.org</pre>
    <p>
    If it does not work, run the following command in order to get a fresh Kerberos ticket:
    </p>
    <pre>kinit jdoe@FOSDEM.ORG</pre>
    <p>(where <code>jdoe</code> is to be replaced by your username on <code class="host">apeiron</code>
    and the other FOSDEM servers)</p>
    <p>
    Then try to run the <code class="cmd">ssh</code> command as above again.
    </p>
    <p>
    If it still does not work, <a href="mailto:server@fosdem.org?subject=Account on apeiron">contact our
      server team by email</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
    If the <code class="cmd">ssh</code> command is successful, you may exit the remote session using
    <code class="cmd">exit</code>, and you are ready to deploy your changes to the website to
    fosdem.org.
    </p>
    <p>
    Note that there are two targets for deployment:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>staging</code>: will deploy to <a href="https://staging.fosdem.org/"><code class="host">
          staging.fosdem.org</code></a></li>
      <li><code>public</code>: will deploy to <a href="http://fosdem.org/"><code class="host">fosdem.org</code></a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Needless to say, be careful before deploying to <code>public</code>, as that is what all the visitors
    of our site will see <tt>:)</tt>.
    </p>
    <h4>Deploying to staging</h4>
    <p>
    To deploy your changes to the website to <a href="https://staging.fosdem.org/"><code class="host">staging.fosdem.org</code></a>,
    run the following command:
    </p>
    <pre>nanoc deploy</pre>
    <p>
    Or, more explicitly:
    </p>
    <pre>nanoc deploy -t staging</pre>
    <h4>Deploying to public</h4>
    <p>
    In a similar fashion, to deploy the changes to our &quot;real&quot; website, do as follows:
    </p>
    <pre>nanoc deploy -t public</pre>
