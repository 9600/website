##### PREPROCESSING
preprocess do
  # clone items that have "aliases: foo, bar, spam" in their metadata
  make_aliases

  # create /headline/... items from content/news/*
  make_headlines

  # auto-set the title of content/interviews/*
  decorate_interviews
end

##### COMPILING

# skip those, as they are combined into content/assets/style/fosdem.css
compile '/assets/style/parts/*' do;end
route '/assets/style/parts/*' do;end

compile '/assets/style/*' do
  # merge all content/assets/style/parts/*.css files into one
  # in content/assets/style/*.css (see the ERB/ruby code there)
  # in order to optimize web browser performance (less HTTP
  # round-trips), see
  # http://userprimary.net/posts/2011/01/10/optimizing-nanoc-based-websites/
  # for inspiration

  # process those using ERB:
  filter :erb
  # then relativize any resource paths (to images and such):
  filter :relativize_paths, :type => :css
  # minimize CSS files:
  filter :rainpress
end

# don't apply any filters on the headlines/* items as they are already
# rendered by the "make_headlines" helper at preprocessing stage
# (they do not exist in the filesystem under content/ -- instead, they
# are items that are created on-the-fly as headlines from content/news/*)
compile '/headlines/*' do;end

compile '/atom/' do
  filter :erb
end

compile '*' do
  if item.binary?
    # donâ€™t filter binary items
  else
    # process <% ERB %> templating
    # http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/erb/rdoc/ERB.html
    filter :erb

    # convert .md and .markdown files to HTML using the
    # kramdown processor
    filter :kramdown if ['markdown', 'md'].include? item[:extension]

    # run the custom interview filter (lib/helpers/interview_filter.rb)
    # on content/interviews/* -- it adds a CC license footer and
    # converts "Q: ..." lines to styled HTML markup
    filter :interview if item.interview?

    # do the same as above for items that have "qa: true" in their
    # metadata, but without adding the license footer
    filter :interview, {:nolicense => true} if item[:filter] == 'qa'

    # run the custom news filter (lib/helpers/news_filter.rb) on
    # content/news/* -- it removes "---MORE---" lines and removes
    # from the beginning of the content until "---FULL---" lines
    # (analog to the make_headlines function from lib/helpers/news.rb
    # which does the "opposite" (kindof) to generate headline items)
    filter :news if item.news?

    # run the custom pagelinks filter (lib/helpers/pagelinks.rb) on
    # all items to replace page:... URLs with their actual URLs as
    # they will be rendered
    filter :pagelinks

    # run the custom assetlinks filter (lib/helpers/assetlinks.rb)
    # on all items to replace asset:... URLs with their actual URLs
    # as they will be rendered
    filter :assetlinks

    # retrieve the image width and height from the image files that
    # are referenced in <img/> tags to speed up browser rendering
    # performance, see
    # http://userprimary.net/posts/2011/01/10/optimizing-nanoc-based-websites/
    # for inspiration, as well as
    # https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/best-practices/rendering#SpecifyImageDimensions
    filter :imagesize

    # transform absolute paths in URLs with relative paths using the
    # relativize_paths filter (that is shipped with nanoc)
    filter :relativize_paths, :type => :xhtml

    # use layout/default.html for all items
    layout 'default' unless item.sponsor?
  end
end

##### ROUTING

# route /headlines/* into oblivion as they don't really exist on
# the site (and are not supposed to): they are created dynamically
# during preprocessing stage (by the "make_headlines" function that's
# defined in lib/helpers/news.rb) and only intended to be gathered
# in content/index.html
route '/headlines/*/' do;end

route '/atom/' do
  '/atom.xml'
end

# deploy content/assets/style/foo.css as output/assets/style/foo.css
# (without this, nanoc would deploy it as output/assets/style/foo/index.html)
route '/assets/*/' do
  if @site.config[:digest_assets] then
    require 'digest/sha2'
    sha = Digest::SHA256.new
    if item.binary? then
      sha << IO.read(item[:filename])
    else
      sha << item.raw_content
    end
    digest = sha.hexdigest.downcase
    "#{item.identifier.chop}-#{digest}.#{item[:extension]}"
  else
    "#{item.identifier.chop}.#{item[:extension]}"
  end
end

# do _not_ deploy the files under content/sponsors/ as they are only used
# programatically in content/about/sponsors.html, but we _do_ want to
# deploy binary files (typically the sponsor logos) that are under
# content/sponsors/, hence the "if item.binary?"
route '/sponsors/*/' do
  if item.binary?
    if item.identifier =~ %r{^(.+)/(.+?)-(big|small)/$} then
      case $3
      when 'big'
        # big logos: /sponsored-by/google.png
        "/sponsored-by/#{$2}.#{item[:extension]}"
      when 'small'
        # small logos: /sponsored-by/thumb/oreilly.png
        "/sponsored-by/thumb/#{$2}.#{item[:extension]}"
      else
        raise "wtf?"
      end
    else
      "/sponsored-by/#{item.id}.#{item[:extension]}"
    end
  else
    # do nothing with the non-binary files
  end
end

route '*' do
  if item.binary?
    # Write binary item with identifier /foo/ to /foo.ext
    item.identifier.chop + '.' + item[:extension]
  else
    # Write text item with identifier /foo/ to /foo/index.html
    item.identifier + 'index.html'
  end

##### LAYOUT PROCESSING
