##### PREPROCESSING
preprocess do
  # clone items that have "aliases: foo, bar, spam" in their metadata
  make_aliases

  # create /headline/... items from content/news/*
  make_headlines

  # auto-set the title of content/interviews/*
  decorate_interviews

end

##### COMPILING

# skip those, as they are combined into content/assets/style/fosdem.css
compile '/assets/style/parts/*' do;end
route '/assets/style/parts/*' do;end

compile '/assets/style/*' do
  # merge all content/assets/style/parts/*.css files into one
  # in content/assets/style/*.css (see the ERB/ruby code there)
  # in order to optimize web browser performance (less HTTP
  # round-trips), see
  # http://userprimary.net/posts/2011/01/10/optimizing-nanoc-based-websites/
  # for inspiration

  # process those using ERB:
  filter :erb
  # then relativize any resource paths (to images and such):
  filter :relativize_paths, :type => :css
  # minimize CSS files:
  filter :rainpress
end

# don't apply any filters on the headlines/* items as they are already
# rendered by the "make_headlines" helper at preprocessing stage
# (they do not exist in the filesystem under content/ -- instead, they
# are items that are created on-the-fly as headlines from content/news/*)
compile '/headlines/*' do;end

compile '*' do
  if item.binary?
    # donâ€™t filter binary items
  else
    # process <% ERB %> templating
    # http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/erb/rdoc/ERB.html
    filter :erb

    unless item[:extension] == 'xml' then
      # convert .md and .markdown files to HTML using the
      # kramdown processor
      filter :kramdown if ['markdown', 'md'].include? item[:extension]

      # run the custom interview filter (lib/helpers/interview_filter.rb)
      # on content/interviews/* -- it adds a CC license footer and
      # converts "Q: ..." lines to styled HTML markup
      filter :interview if item.interview?

      # do the same as above for items that have "qa: true" in their
      # metadata, but without adding the license footer
      filter :interview, {:nolicense => true} if item[:filter] == 'qa'

      # run the custom news filter (lib/filters/news_filter.rb) on
      # content/news/* -- it removes "---MORE---" lines and removes
      # from the beginning of the content until "---FULL---" lines
      # (analog to the make_headlines function from lib/helpers/news.rb
      # which does the "opposite" (kindof) to generate headline items)
      filter :news if item.news?

      # run the custom pagelinks filter (lib/filters/pagelinks.rb) on
      # all items to replace page:... URLs with their actual URLs as
      # they will be rendered
      filter :pagelinks

      # run the custom assetlinks filter (lib/filters/assetlinks.rb)
      # on all items to replace asset:... URLs with their actual URLs
      # as they will be rendered
      filter :assetlinks

      # run the custom schedulelinks filter (lib/filters/schedulelinks.rb)
      # on all items to replace speaker:..., event:... and track:...
      # URLs with their actual URLs as they will be rendered, including
      # e.g. speaker:2012/foobar that will point to archive.fosdem.org/...
      filter :schedulelinks

      # retrieve the image width and height from the image files that
      # are referenced in <img/> tags to speed up browser rendering
      # performance, see
      # http://userprimary.net/posts/2011/01/10/optimizing-nanoc-based-websites/
      # for inspiration, as well as
      # https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/best-practices/rendering#SpecifyImageDimensions
      filter :imagesize

      # transform absolute paths in URLs with relative paths using the
      # relativize_paths filter (that is shipped with nanoc)
      filter :relativize_paths, :type => :xhtml

      layout 'default' unless item.sponsor?
    end

end

##### ROUTING

# route /headlines/* into oblivion as they don't really exist on
# the site (and are not supposed to): they are created dynamically

# defined in lib/helpers/news.rb) and only intended to be gathered
# in content/index.html
route '/headlines/*/' do;end

# (without this, nanoc would deploy it as output/assets/style/foo/index.html)
